Fitness wise, I was able to surf, ride my bike and get into the climbing gym a few times. As far as computer programming, I was very close to releasing a few open source products and started taking to the time to get up to date with basic knowledge of current popular MVCs.</p>
<h2>Surfing has been great sans a little rain</h2>
<p>With a lot of rain in LA week, surfing was a safety hazard. This was because of run off from land and all of the water being stirred up. What all of the rain has taken away from everyday surfing has been added to awesome waves on the few days I was able to get out. I went to <a href="http://www.surfline.com/surf-report/county-line-southern-california_4203/">Countyline</a> with <a href="http://justinintime.com/">Justin Berg</a>. The sets were consistent and the wave shapes were very nice. It was my first time in the water for 2017 so I was pleasantly was surprised I was able to turn on a few waves.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I went to <a href="http://www.surfline.com/surf-report/sunset-beach-southern-california_119813/">Sunset Surf Spot</a> and enjoyed some perfect waves. I got some long rides and even a few good turns. I was out on my <a href="http://www.benaipa.com/">Aipa</a> Surfboard which doesn't seem to float as well any more—I still had so much fun.</p>
<h2>Slow and steady makes the smile show</h2>
<p>Cycling was feeling pretty good and after adding <a href="https://touchstoneclimbing.com/cliffs-of-id/">boulder climbing</a> to my workout routine—my hips are feeling alright. I logged a little under <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201701&#x26;interval_type=week&#x26;chart_type=miles&#x26;year_offset=0">150 miles</a>. My pace was slow and I still felt hesitant with hills. I was lucky to have Devin join me on a few rides.</p>
<h2>Open Source, small things that grow</h2>
<p>Maintaining my first larger open source projects in <a href="https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/shave">Shave</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/reframe.js">Reframe.js</a> has continued to be interesting. I've learn from the questions I've received and the updates I've asked to make. Meanwhile, I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/scrolldir/stargazers">ScrollDir</a> with <a href="https://github.com/pwfisher">Patrick Fisher</a> and another Project called StickyBits.</p>
<h2>JavaScript Framework Learnings</h2>
<p>I've had the opportunity to dig deeper into some JavaScript Frameworks. The frameworks that I've been learning more about are <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://svelte.technology/">Svelte</a>. I've been comparing these frameworks to writing something that could be considered more basic using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> with <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>. Knowing that these learnings will be done on a content site that still has relatively low traffic, speed on initial visit is very key. Hopefully, I can document more on my learnings soon!</p></div><div class="post__giscus"></div></div><aside class="aside"><div class="aside__meta"><header class="aside__header"><h3 class="aside__title">Week 1, 2017—the weather was rainy but the surf was great!</h3></header><section class="share"><nav class="share__nav"><button class="share__button">Share Article Link</button></nav></section></div></aside></section></article><footer class="site-footer" role="contentinfo" itemType="http://schema.org/WPFooter"><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--main"><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--contact"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Contact</h3><address class="site-footer__address"><p class="site-footer__content">Happy to chat, learn, help!</p><p class="site-footer__content"><a href="mailto:yowainwright@gmail.com">yowainwright@gmail.com</a>, Los Angeles, CA</p></address></article><div class="site-footer__col site-footer__col site-footer__col--social"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Connect</h3><nav class="social-footer"><ul class="social-list"><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://github.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Github</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://instagram.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Instragram</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrywainwright/" class="social-list__link">LinkedIn</a></li></ul></nav></div><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--self"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--self">About</h3><figure class="site-footer__figure"><img class="media--circular site-footer__image" src="https://yowainwright.imgix.net/portraits/me-smiling.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Me smiling with a beard"/><figcaption class="site-footer__caption"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/"><strong>jeffry.in</strong>, <!-- -->2025</a>, is the blog of<!-- --> <a class="site-footer__link" href="/about">Jeffry (Jeff) Wainwright</a>, a software engineer, person, living in Los Angeles.</figcaption></figure></article></section><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--last"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--last"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/">jeffry.in</a>, <!-- -->2025</h3></section></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Week 1, 2017—the weather was rainy but the surf was great!","meta":"This post summarizes week 1 of 2017","categories":["note","story"],"date":"January 13, 2017","path":"/week-1-17"},"content":"\u003cp\u003eMy first week of 2017 was rainy but the surf was great!
