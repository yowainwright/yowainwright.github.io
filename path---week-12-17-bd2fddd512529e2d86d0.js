This changed my schedule so I decided to head out in nature for the weekend. I went to Wrightwood, CA. </p>\n<h2>Wrightwood, CA</h2>\n<p>Wrightwood, CA is South East of Los Angeles. It is a slightly less known mountain town when compared with other towns in a close proximity—like Big Bear. Near to Wrightwood are group of rocks called ‘The Mormon Rocks’. They look like large rounded blocks of cement and they’re powerful against the landscape because other blocks in the area look different. Wrightwood has a ski hill, Mountain High, with hiking trails all around it. I went on 2 runs while I was there summiting to mountains which were about 7000ft each.</p>\n<html><head></head><body><figure>\n  \n</figure></body></html>\n<p>I’m still behind on writing a few posts outside of my weekly posts so I’m going to pause this post and hopefully be catch up next week. </p>',frontmatter:{featured_image:"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-12/mormon-rocks-2.jpg",meta:"Week 12, I was given the opportunity to catch up with some people I care about and visit Wrightwood, CA for the first time.",title:"Week 12, 2017—getting the opportunity to listen see a new place",date:"April 06, 2017"}}},pathContext:{path:"/week-12-17/"}}}});
