I'm getting to this post a bit late—1 week. Why? I switched teams at work. I will now be working analytics.

## Working on Analytics

I'm very happy to working on building an analtyics tool for my company. The tool will take information from when a customer navigates our site and turn that information into a data object that can be used by various analytics platforms like Adobe, Looker or Google Analytics.
