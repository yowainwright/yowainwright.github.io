meta: Recently, I lost a friend. Lauren Schlueter was a friend of mine who helped me through laughter. She was a historian, a teacher and a comedian.

Lauren and I met through a mutual friend of ours from Chicago. When she arrived in Manhattan Beach, where I lived, we became fast friends. At the time, I was recovering from a serious bout with Pneumonia. The sickness has left me a bit depressed. She had just gone through some changes of her own making us the perfect travel/hang-out duo.

After meeting, we immediately discussed politics and history. She was passionate about certain things, like Cuba, and these certain things she could describe in great detail which I could listen to for hours. I truly enjoyed debating certain points with her just because of how my I would learn when she would respond. 

She had a lot to say about several television shows. I know, many do‚Äîbut not like Lauren. She could converse, debate and laugh about each episode of a show she was a fan of in so much detail. I would just watch shows to connect dots of the stories Lauren would tell about shows. 

The first trip that she roped-me-into was from Chicago to Orlando, in the dead of winter. I don't know why she asked me to go but we went. We left Chicago in a blizzard and I remember thinking, 'This is a horrible idea! Why am I the one who is doing this?'. We stopped in Memphis and listened to blues before heading further South‚Äîto the Gulf of Mexico. 

I remember arriving close to the Gulf of Mexico and asking if we could watch the sunset from the Gulf. We went to an old lighthouse for the sunset. The water was so calm; much more calm than I ever see in the Pacific. Lauren walked to shore facing the sun, buckled her knees (as she would) and crossed her arms. She looked almost mad at first. Then she took in a deep breath and it seemed that her whole body melted in view. It was the best sunset. At that moment, I was so glad I was on that trip with her. After, I arriving in Orlando I assumed I wouldn't see her again. She had made plans to be a teacher abroad. 

A few weeks later, she reached out with a request to drive to Big Sur‚Äîa place she had wanted to go to and a favorite place of mine. She came back out to California and we drove up the coast staying in Santa Barbara, Monterey, and Morro Bay. It was a memorable trip. Lauren left to teach in Doha after. 

Lauren and I would touch base after‚Äîto reflect on our trips, what was up in our lives and reminisce a bit about fun times we'd had. She'd seemed well and that made me happy. I felt like we'd grown so much together. For myself, I'd learned how to live my life outside of who I'd been before Pneumonia. The new me was a bit more accepting of myself and I am thankful for what I learned from Lauren. I felt a stronger desire to just-enjoy-stuff and accept the people I care about for who the are and were. 

I'll never forget Lauren for that and our trips. She will live on in my mind; appreciating a sunsetting, accepting the world so much that she seemed to become a part of it. She will be missed. I think I'll always see a bit of her in every sunset I watch‚Äîa quite good-bye mixed with fiery light. Miss you Lauren Schlueter. üôè
