> This page was created so that people using old versions of Internet Explorer or would like to view a simplified version of my resume could. I, as well as others, might actually prefer all of my pages and posts to look and preform like this page but because I'm a front end developer and designer; I've coded to suite using semantic ui. Enjoy!
