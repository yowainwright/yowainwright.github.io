[Glendora Mountain Road](http://www.differentspokes.com/index.cfm?action=showEvent&eventID=1888) or GMR is approximately a 20 mile ride where you’ll be challenged with climbs, turns & a strong desire to take a lot of pictures.

Route: The route, found [all over strave](https://www.strava.com/segments/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&keywords=gmr&gsf=1), starts in [Azusa, CA](http://www.ci.azusa.ca.us/) & ends in [Mount Baldy Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Baldy,_California).

Parking: For the ride I parked my car at [Bike Central](http://www.thebicyclecentral.com/) which is a short & easy ride to the GMR. Beware if you follow Google directions for bicycles you WILL end up on a hiking trail not suited for road bikes unless you & your bike are way more bad ass than me.

Water & Food: That’s a pretty cool part about this ride because, well, you don’t have to worry much. There’s water & food in Azusa & there’s water & food in Mount Baldy Village so if you plan on 20 miles in between both points - you should be good.

Key sites: During most of the ride you’ll have great views. Particularly, you’ll be able to see the [San Gabriel Reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Dam) which, I’ve semi-joked with friends about being the last visible water in LA. You’ll also be able to see Mount Baldy & other high hills & mounts which do a great job of making a rider feel small & in adequate in the world.

The trip personally for me was bitter sweet. One of my best riding buds, [Brett Pitts](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1283635?oq=bre), is about to move so we decided we had to make the ride happen. We zipped up the inline from Azusa & raced on the ridge after switching to [Glendora Ridge Rd](http://www.toughascent.com/blog/tag/glendora-ridge-road/). We made the ride in the middle of November so we were comfortable riding with our kits & a vest. I wore my [Rapha Lightweight Kit & Vest](http://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/gift-bundles/category/bundles) & it suited me perfectly for the ride.
