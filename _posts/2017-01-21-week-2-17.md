Wow, writing a weekly update will be challenging to stick to but valuable. The rain has continued to linger which great for water levels and local waterfalls up above Pasadena‚ÄîI've enjoyed thoroughly. Beyond that, JavaScript MVC discovery has led to new open source projects to make and a few projects to contribute to as well. 

## Mueller Tunnel Hike Continues to Enchant Eyes üèû

Mueller Tunnel is located about a mile from the summit of [Mount Wilson](https://www.mtwilson.edu/). It's easy to park and view [Los Angeles lights](https://www.instagram.com/p/5ey73zSf9Z/) at sunset. Then after an easy quarter mile hike you get to the tunnel which can [capture silloutes wonderfully](https://www.instagram.com/p/BL7mWWwDd_n/). If the hike is continued past the tunnel you can reach the summit of Mount Disappointment which offers another view of Los Angeles from mountain tops and has an interesting story behind it's [name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Disappointment_(California)). 


## Riding In the Rain‚Äîon a board or bike üö¥

Cycling has continued to be a challenge with the rain however views from the saddle are irresistable. I was able to maintain a bit over [130](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201702&interval_type=week&chart_type=miles&year_offset=0) but my hips were a concern going into my third week. I was able to remedy this with a bit of surfing and climbing in the gym. Yeah, gym climbing has been great for me. It challenges me to stretch and relax.

## Nuxt, Next and Svelte ü¶Ñ

Over the past week, I reseached [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Next](https://zeit.co/blog/next) and [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/). I'm currently working on basic setups for Nuxt and Next with a [mentor of mine](https://github.com/briangonzalez/). If it makes sense, those projects will be open sourced. I'm also planning on using Svelte personally on this site. I'm a huge fan of [Rich Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris). [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) is my go to for open source projects because it keeps my code more honest. 


## Tried and True üêò

I didn't have a chance to wrap up an open source project that I hoped to release this week‚Äîhopefully next week. I'm also hoping to write a [jQuery builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-builder) because the projects seems a bit stale and could maybe be optimized in a few ways. My goals, if I have time will be to make a modern way to create the jQuery that is needed for a project. Aside from that, I've done some deep learning on [progressive web apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and automatting a weekly [webpage performance report](http://danielmall.com/articles/how-to-make-a-performance-budget/).

Last but not least, I got my first custom surfboard made by [Caleb, 'Critter Surfboards'](https://www.instagram.com/critterssurfboards/).
