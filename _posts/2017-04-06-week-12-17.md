After my car was side-swiped [last week](https://jeff.in/week-12-17/), I didn't feel comfortable putting surfboards into the my car rental because of the wax. This changed my schedule so I decided to head out in nature for a bit. I went to Wrightwood, CA for the first time over the weekend. Traveling to and from Wrightwood, I was able to catch up with friends. At work and over the weekend, I was building new functionality for our tool that constructs a data layer to be consumed by various analytics tools. If the last sentence was confusing, I'll hopefully be able to explain it better below.
