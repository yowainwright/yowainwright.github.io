This past week has been a tough week for some people I'm close to. I thought about my friends a lot and tried to be there from them as best I could think of. With a lot of extra hard work outside of work, a user interface plugin I made for Dollar Shave Club has started to gain momentum. Check out and start [Stickybits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits)!
