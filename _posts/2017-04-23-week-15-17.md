This past week has been a tough week for me because some people I care about deeply dealt with or are dealing with some challenges. I thought about my friends a lot and tried to be there from them as best I could think of. With a lot of extra hard work outside of work, a user interface plugin I made for Dollar Shave Club has started to gain momentum. Check out, read and star [Stickybits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits) if you have time!
