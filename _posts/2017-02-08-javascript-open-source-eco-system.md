I separate JavaScript Open Source Projects into 4 categories. It's important for me to remember these categories when learning about projects so that I can better realize my time spent learning, building and tooling with JavaScript. Currently (2017), JavaScript churn is real and it is easy to be overwhelmed. I find that when I break down projects this way, I'm able to invest my time appropriately and pick the tools I want to use faster. 

-  Plugins ðŸ”Œ
-  Libraries ðŸ“š
-  Frameworks ðŸ–¼
-  Services ðŸ”§

ðŸ”Œ&nbsp;&nbsp;**Plugins:** are a small usable functions. They do 1 thing should be usable across a wide spectrum of Frameworks, Libraries, and services. If I can't make a plugin work within several minutes, then I have to move on. 

ðŸ“š&nbsp;&nbsp;**Libraries:** are groups of utilities. Libraries are projects like [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) or [LoDash](https://lodash.com/). They create ways for their users to more easily do things like manipulate html. I find I change libraries minimally so I tend to go for rock solid products that are stable and well documented.

ðŸ–¼&nbsp;&nbsp;**Frameworks:** are projects like [Angular](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), or [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). They establish patterns for writing entire systems of code. Frameworks are cornerstone in products that I build so when choosing a framework for a product I tend to build little apps and think about how the functionality will apply to the project. I'm willing to invest a few days understand the basics of a Framework only to not use it at the end of discovery.

ðŸ”§&nbsp;&nbsp;**Services:** are things like task runners ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) or [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)). These sorts of tools make it easier to compile things like Frameworks or Libraries. Services often go along with tooling so time spent is in configuration. I tend to spend a few hours setting up services for new projects. 

Separating JavaScript Projects into 4 categories gives my brain a digestible way to approach the JavaScript tools I use. It's very easy to hop on twitter and read about new thing after new thing and feel overwhelmed. When binging like that it's nice to bucket things better time and building allocation.
