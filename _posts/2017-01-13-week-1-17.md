My first week of 2017 was pretty good. Fitness wise, I was able to surf, riding my bike and get into the climbing gym a few times. As far as computer programming, I'm very close to release a few new open source products and have started talking to the time to get up to date with a basic understanding of current popular MVCs. 

## Surfing has been great sans a little rain üåä üí¶

With a lot of rain in LA this week, surfing was a safety hazard. This is because of runoff from land and all of the water being stirred up. What all of the rain has taken away from everyday surfing has been added to awesome waves on the few days I was able to get out. I went to [Countyline](http://www.surfline.com/surf-report/county-line-southern-california_4203/) with [Justin Berg](http://justinintime.com/). The sets were consistant and the shape was very nice. It was my first time in the water in the new year and was surprised I was able to turn on a few waves.

On Sunday, I went to [Sunset Surf Spot](http://www.surfline.com/surf-report/sunset-beach-southern-california_119813/) and enjoyed some perfect waves. I got some long rides and even a few good turns. I was out on my Aipa which doesn't seem to float as well‚ÄîI still had so much fun.

## Slow and steady makes the smile show üòä

Cycling has felt pretty good and after adding [climbing](https://touchstoneclimbing.com/cliffs-of-id/) to my workout routine‚Äîmy hips are feeling alright. I logged a little under[150 miles](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201701&interval_type=week&chart_type=miles&year_offset=0). My pace was slow and I'm still very hesitant with hills. I've been doing a lot of rides at night from Playa Vista to the end of Redondo Beach which has been really nice. I've been lucky to have [Devin](https://twitter.com/D_fman) join me on a few rides.

## Open Source, small things that grow üå±

I've been maintains my first larger open source projects in [Shave](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/shave) and [Reframe.js](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/reframe.js) which has continued to be interesting as I learn from the questions I've received and the updates I'm asked to make. Meanwhile, I'm working on [ScrollDir](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/scrolldir/stargazers) with [Patrick Fisher](https://github.com/pwfisher) and another Project called StickyBits. Other things I'd like to do are on the back burner until I can release and market those products.

## JavaScript Framework Learnings ü¶Ñ

This past week, I've had the opportunity to dig deeper into some JavaScript Frameworks. The frameworks that I've been learning more about are [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/). I've been comparing these to writing something that could be considered more basic with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](http://expressjs.com/). Knowing that these learnings will be done on a content site that still has relatively low traffic, speed on initial visit is very key. Hopefully, I can document more on my learnings soon! üê•
