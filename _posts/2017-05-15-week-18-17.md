meta: Week 18, a trip to the North West to celebrate my sister's birthday

This week I wrapped up work on a variance issue with an analytics tool. Outside of working I was still dealing an ankle injury. I combated these things by heading up to visit my sister for her birthday. My sister has recently be up in Northwestern United Statesâ€”a great place to enjoy moody weather and lots of coffee.
