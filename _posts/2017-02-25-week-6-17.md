The sixth week of 2017 included more rain in Southern California which again led to great waves in the later part of the week. I pushed my 3000th commit of the year on Github which was very important for me. At work, we released major analytics updates and I began working on some simpilar things that can really improve performance—like code splitting. 

## Rain In Southern California (Storm of the Decade)

One of my best friends, [Quitin Radford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quintinradford), founder of [Uensil](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/903862437/sporklettm-0) and his wife Jill (who I would now call a friend) came and visited. They went surfing with me at Venice Beach's Breakwater without wetsuits because I didn't have extras which was pretty impressive because the water is frigid in February. Jill first, paddled out. Other surfers didn't know what to think. They were chuckling subtly under there breath. Until she started charging waves. She didn't seem to care about the weather at all. It was inspiring. I think the whole beach was stoked!

We had more rain the day after our surf adventure. This particular rain was called [The Storm of the Decade](http://www.businessinsider.com/los-angeles-storm-rain-california-2017-2). Quintin, Jill and I went out to surf just before the storm and realized quickly that that would have been a bad idea. We, instead, went up the coast on Highway 1 to enjoy the storm from the ocean caves around [Leo Carillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Carrillo). It was a fantastic moment—one that I will not forget.

## 3000 Commits on Github and Analytics

There has always been a challenge that I've felt about who I am and the way the I think and code. I'm passionate about keeping things realistic and as simple as possible. With that passionate, I also try to maintain the things that I dream about. I dress in a simple way and speak and use language in a jovial way. I don't see a discrepency between these things but I think others might. This is way I like that there can be things like Github commits that point out—'Hey, this guy gets shit done!' And I do. I will continue to release simple usable open source projects and commit at a rapid rate for the projects that I'm working on.

Besides, my own little atta-boy, we released an analytics update to the product that I'm working on which went smashingly well. The reason for this is that the communication was good amoungst the team. I continue to find that when communication is clear for analytics—the code can be very simple to write.
