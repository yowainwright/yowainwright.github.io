The sixth week of 2017 was filled with Rain in Southern California but at the end of it we had some great waves. I think I pushed my 3000th commit this week on github which was very important for me. At work, we released a lot of work related to analytics and I've begun working on some basic things that can really improve performance—like code splittings.
