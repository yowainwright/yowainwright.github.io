				<p class="introduction">The more I do as a developer, the more things I want to try and the more the word <em>free</em> comes into play; things that are <em>free</em> to use, things that offer <em>free</em>-dom. This is where Jekyll Comes into play, that and Github Pages - it gives me a lot of control easily ... for <em>free</em>.</p>

I started reading about Jekyll 2 years ago but didn't see the benefit to try it out until I Github pages announced that you could host static Jekyll Sites using Github pages for free. So far the process of making my personal web page using Jekyll has been fun and easy. I'm hoping to update this post as I build the site to document useful notes that helped me.
