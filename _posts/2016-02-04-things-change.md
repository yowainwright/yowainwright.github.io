Remembering the first time I saw [William Kentridge](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kentridge): it was in Chicago & I drove down from Madison with my girlfriend. I was 21 maybe (I'm 35 now) & I threw a bit of a temper tantrum while trying to find a place to park.

I remember seeing my girlfriend's face when I got out of the car. She had big green eyes that were looking at me so empathically. "I'm going to dump you in a few months" I could imagine her thinking. It's not that even then I didn't have good qualities but all there was to me was ... well, me. But, this is a story of the moment that I think that changed for me. This was the first time I was going to see artwork by William Kentridge.

The William Kentridge Exhibit was at the [MCA](//mcachicago.org/Home) & it was during the winter. I remember it being cold & me feeling grumpy, even after my car was parked. I drove a long way get here (I thought to myself). I am so busy & have finals & I don't have time for this (I thought to myself). I think that even then my hair was thinning. I can remember, or at least imagine, tufts of blond hair on top of my intense looking head blowing in the wind as my girlfriend & I walked up the steps to the museum. My hair & her planning their escape. My hair: "I'm going to slowly & politely leave out the back". My girlfriend: "Ah, the fade away. Me too!".

We all (my hair, my girlfriend & me) entered the museum & got to the exhibit which was a series of installation videos & charcoal sketches that orchastrated the videos.

As I was watching the movies which dealt with time & social issues in South Africa during that time I felt my intense heart getting soft. My girlfriend looked at me, tears welling in my eyes, this is what I remember her liking about me - my ability to be there, in a moment. Grabbing her hand & we walked around the museum together, every Kentridge Piece bringing me closer to a new part of myself. I felt myself being curious about the world which Kentridge was creating & described & that narrative extended to wondering about my girlfriend’s feelings. I'd been selfish. We'd drove down from Madison together & she was taking the same finals as me.

It was truly a glorious moment.

We went back to Madison, had our finals. I went to Europe for the holiday & Deirdre (what we'll call my ex girlfriend) left me for someone while I was away. I remember talking to her on my Nokia cell phone on a beach in Albania. There were locals literally fishing with dynamite in the not so distant background. "What?!" I exclaimed to the sound of dynamite exploding in the background; fish & fish guts going every which way a few hundred meters out at sea.

Years later, I did a series of work - fully embracing that eye opening situation & the new door to life that was accessed after seeing William Kentridge’s work.
