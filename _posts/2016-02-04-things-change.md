Remembering the first time I saw [William Kentridge](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kentridge): it was in Chicago & I drove down from Madison, Madison Wisconsin with my girlfriend. I was around 21. I'm 35 now. I threw a temper tantrum while trying to find a place to park in the magnificent mile area.

After parking, I remember looking into girlfriend's big green eyes right after we got out of the car. She was looking at me so empathically. "I'm going to dump you in a few months" she was probably thinking still waiting for right exit. It's not that I didn't have good qualities then. I was full of charisma & passion but my passion was usually about art or skateboarding & _I could be selfish_ in general. But, this moment at the MCA, seeing Kentridge's work for the first time, was a moment in which my passion for art allowed me to be open to a beautiful world ... outside of me.

The Kentridge Exhibit was at the [MCA](//mcachicago.org/Home) & it was during the winter. I remember the weather being cold & me feeling grumpy, even after my car was parked. I drove a long way get here (I thought to myself). I am so busy & have semester finals & I don't have time for this (I thought to myself). I think that even then my hair was thinning. I can remember, or at least imagine, tufts of blond hair on top of my intense furrowed face blowing in the wind as my girlfriend & I walked up the steps to the museum. My hair & her planning their escape. My hair: "I'm going to slowly & politely leave out the back". My girlfriend: "Ah, the fade away. Me too!".

We all (my hair, my girlfriend & me) entered the museum & got to the exhibit. The exhibit was a series of installation videos. Each video was a narrative done in charcoal frames. As I understand it, Kentridge would do the drawing & then manipulate the charcoal for multiple stills of the each video. Then, the rest of the gallery space was the final sketch from each still that's comprised the video. It was impressive. I loved Kentride's confidence to make the drawing & then change it. It takes a rare artist to be unafraid of changing work to further communicate a narrative. This is why I found this exhibit so exciting.

As I was watching Kentridge's short films which dealt with time & social issues in South Africa during that time I felt my intense heart getting soft. Kentridge's sketches did more than demonstrate a deep understanding of space techinically but also had feeling. It seemed to me that Kentridge wanted to _have a point_ more than _a beautiful sketch_. My girlfriend looked at me, I had tears welling in my eyes. This is what I remember her liking about me - my ability to be there, in a moment. I could just love something. I grabbed her hand & we walked around the museum together smiling with tears in my eyes (a common scenerio for me still). I felt myself being curious about the world which Kentridge had created. His narrative extended to me wondering about my girlfriend’s reality & her feelings. I'd been selfish earlier that day, throwing tantrums & being grumpy. We'd drove down from Madison together & she was taking the same semester finals as me at the same college. I had made the drive & the trip all about me.

After getting dinner, we went back to Madison. It was business as usual, studying for finals & going to class. We didn't talk much about those moments at the MCA. In general, at that time, I had an amazing gift of being a light hearted, center of a party type of guy until **I wasn't**. So we coasted until the semester was done. Those moments probably probably were in the front of both of our minds & but the furthest thing from words.

My parents where diplomats stationed in Albania at the time so once finals were over I went & visited them in Tirana. I liked Albania. It has amazing fruit. The people were friendly to me & didn't seem to get terribly upset that I was a character. One day I went with a group down by the sea. There were fisherman fishing with dynamite at the beach we were at. I got a call from my girlfriend on my Nokia Cell Phone (remember: 2000/2001). "Do you have time to talk?", she asked. "Of course.", I said; dynamite explosions happening in the background. "I've met someone; someone else", she said, "I don't want to be with you anymore.". At that moment, a dynamite explosion happened. Fish & fish guts fly into the air. I could hear the fisherman boys' glee as they giggled near by. "I understand.", I said to my girlfriend on the phone.

>"I don't want to be with you anymore.". At that moment, a dynamite explosion happened. Fish & fish guts fly into the air.

We, Emily (my girlfriend of that time) & I, talked a few times after that & not about us really. The conversations were more along the lines of: "Can I get this back?". There was never much closure & there didn't have to be. We were very different & I'd been a selfish boyfriend for the most part. I think fondly of moments I spent with her & I smile when I think of my first time seeing William Kentridge & getting dumped to the sound of fish being blown up with dynamite in the background (not about the fish being blown up specifically - I'm not into that).

Years later, I did a series of work - fully embracing that eye opening situation & the new door to life that was accessed after seeing William Kentridge’s work.
