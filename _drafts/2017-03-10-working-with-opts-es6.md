There is always open source plugin code that can easily become confusing. After writing a few open source plugins, I've realized that readability is very important to get help and make code better. One thing where readability becomes very confusing for me is options code. In this short post, I will go over options code in JavaScript Plugins and how it can be improved. 

## What are options?

> Options are properties with default values that can be changed by users of the plugin.

Options are properties with default values that can be changed by users of the plugin. In example, sometime a plugin will have a default css class that it is associated with. Plugins will often allow users to change this default class. 

Here an example of how options look in current JavaScript:
{% highlight javaScript %}

{% endhighlight %}
And here's how it can be changed when it is initiated:
{% highlight javaScript %}

{% endhighlight %}
