Riding bikes around white rock late when I went to Denver was very special to me. I felt the humid Texas air against my skin. I listened to the sounds of wildlife turn up the sun went down. The light as it creeped below the horizon of the lake peeked rays through the soft tree landscape. It reminded me of my childhood.

When I was young, traveling between parents home, I would visit family around the lakes of Wisconsin. My older cousins would ride boats & water ski. As 1 of the younger cousins, I would swim within the shallow parts around docks. We would sometime get in canoes & look for crawfish, turtles & frogs. At night, we would try to catch fireflies.

Life seemed very simple. It seemed like a place by the water was every family's goal. It you didn't have much - you could stay with another member of the family. I don't know if that community exists as much anymore. I know it doesn't for me. I felt very proud & content.

When riding my bike, here, around White Rock Lake, I was surprised by how many families were here & how alive the park seemed. When I was done with my ride, my friend pointed out a firefly & said, it's been so long since I've seen 1 of those. Me too, I said. I felt community in that moment at White Rock that I hadn't felt in years.

I hadn't ever been to Texas before that but I have to say, I felt that pride. I liked seeing the fireflies light flare up before it went away.
