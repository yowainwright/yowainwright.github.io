The first time I met Lauren—it was pretty much one of the coolest things of my life. One of my best friends girlfriend's, hit me up and said she had a friend that was visiting Southern California and asked if I'd want to meet up with _her_. _Her_? I was generally excited to meet a_her_, especially if she was beautiful—which she was. I tried to play it cool in the 30 seconds that it took me to reply, "Yeah sure, I'd be up to meet her". 

A few days later I got a text from Lauren that she could come visit me that night where I was living in Manhattan Beach. I don't think the seconds could go fast enough when I was a work because I was so excited to see her. So many things were going through my mind. Who is Lauren? What is she like? Would she like me? Don't overthink this. Who are you kidding? You are going to over think this. 

When I got home, Lauren was already there. We greeted each other awkwardly. She was so beautiful. I asked her if she would want to ride bikes down to Hermosa Beach for dinner. She said okay, so we did. I remember the evening was foggy and the waves had been very large along the coast. To me, it seemed like I'd gone back in time and we were riding bikes on an old time boardwalk. It was wonderful. 

During dinner, Lauren and I discussed politics and philosophy. We joked about life and love. Lauren was smart, fiery and funny. I remember thinking, 'this is a person that will stand for something when it matters'. 

I wanted to kiss her after dinner but didn't what to be rude or assume that she would feel the same. We rode bikes to Manhattan Beach Pier and walked out on the Pier. The waves were so big that the spray from them was crashing over the Pier. I asked her, if she would want to kiss me and she said laughing, 'Are you serious? You can do better than that!'. I immediatedly loved that about Lauren. She wasn't going to fake it. She'd make light of it ...but she wasn't going to fake it. 

After that initial meeting Lauren and I joked around a lot via text. A few months later we met in Chicago and drove down South to Florida. We visited ended up arriving at the Gulf of Mexico to enjoy a sunset that I will never forget.

Lauren and I had been friends for a few years. I met her through a mutual friend of ours from Chicago. When she arrived in Manhattan Beach, where I lived, we became fast friends. At the time, I was recovering from a serious bout with Pneomonia. The sickness has left me a bit depressed. She had just gone through some changes of her own making her the perfect travel/hang-out buddy.

We immediately discussed politics and history. She was passionate about certain things and these certain things she could describe in great detail which was interesting. I truly enjoyed debating certain points with her just because of how my I would learn when she would respond. 

Besides that, she had a lot for many television shows. I know, many do—but not like Lauren. She could converse, debate and laugh about each episode in so much detail. I truly would just watch shows so that I could connect _some_ of the dots for the summation I knew I would get from Lauren. 

Our relationship was very much debative and that was what was so nice for me
