This site is built with [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/). Building things with Jekyll is efficient, in-expensive & easy to extend. Really all you need is a url & place to host some text files.

## Concept

When building this site, I knew I wanted a few things.

1. I knew I wanted to pass off the contact form stuff to email (even though you can have a contact form with Jekyll - [see my old site for reference](//jeffry.in/old-jeffry-in/contact/), or to send me an email through a contact form)

2. I knew that to make building the site worth while, I'd want to be able to extend modules to other jekyll projects.

### Why did I want to use 3rd party stuff so much?

Well, I'm not writing posts here to re-invent the wheel on social behavior, business logic or any of that. My posts & this site are to create custom _Jeff_ *experiences* for customers within the content that I create - however small of a difference that might be from other web page experiences. So, with that being said: users have their facebook, twitter, email & disqus to communicate, if they were to so choose, about the *experiences* I create.

## I highlighted _experiences_ in the above paragraph a few times & why

Experiences are a key to great content & they're often a balancing act which rely on customer's desire for:

- Quality content
- Time
- Unique Interface
