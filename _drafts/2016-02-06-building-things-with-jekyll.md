This site is built with [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/). Building things with Jekyll is efficient, in-expensive & easy to extend. Really all you need is a url & place to host some text files.

## Concept

When building this site, I knew I wanted a few things.

- I knew I wanted to pass off the contact form stuff to email (even though you can have a contact form with Je
kyll - [see my old site for reference](//jeffry.in/old-jeffry-in/contact/), or to send me an email through a contact form)

- I knew that to make building the site worth while, I'd want to be able to extend modules to other jekyll projects
