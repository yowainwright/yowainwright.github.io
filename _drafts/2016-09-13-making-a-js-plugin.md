I've made a few small JavaScript Open Source plugins. While making them, I've had a few _a-ha_ moments. They should be simple. The functionality should be all that matters. Looking for ways to make them usuable across as many platforms as possible is key. 

## Plugins Should Be Simple

Plugins should be simple means that plugins should do the 1 thing that they are supposed to do. I label JavaScript Open Source Projects into 4 things. 

-  Frameworks
-  Libraries
-  Plugins
-  Services


## The Functionality Is What Matters


## Plugins Should Be Very Usable


## Why make these small plugins?
