The weather in Southern California has improved greatly. 

## ScrollDir, vertical scroll direction without jitter

Mueller Tunnel is located about a mile from the summit of [Mount Wilson](https://www.mtwilson.edu/). It's easy to park and view [Los Angeles lights](https://www.instagram.com/p/5ey73zSf9Z/) at sunset. Then after an easy quarter mile hike you get to the tunnel which can [capture silloutes wonderfully](https://www.instagram.com/p/BL7mWWwDd_n/). If the hike is continued past the tunnel you can reach the summit of Mount Disappointment which offers another view of Los Angeles from mountain tops and has an interesting story behind it's [name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Disappointment_(California)). I walked there this past Sunday, the 15th. Clouds appeared to be surfing the mountain ridge line and all of the rain has created unusual and beautiful waterfalls which are traversing the mountain valleys.


## Roads seem clearest when illuminated by light piercing through darkness

Cycling has continued to be a challenge with the rain however views from the saddle are irresistable. I was able to maintain a bit over [130](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201702&interval_type=week&chart_type=miles&year_offset=0) but my hips were a concern going into my third week. I was able to remedy this with a bit of surfing and climbing in the gym. Yeah, gym climbing has been great for me. It challenges me to stretch and relax.
