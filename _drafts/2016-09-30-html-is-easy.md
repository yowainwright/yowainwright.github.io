Most developers seem to have gone the route of bulldozing right past _deep html_ learning ðŸšœ. It makes sense. We're given jobs where quizzes and interview questions demand answers that have nothing to do with - can you write valid html? If developers were asked that question, I imagine some might even feel insulted.

[Semantic html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML) is often an assumed part of writing webpages - like, 'of course the webpges are semantic' or 'is that even a issue with modern webpages?'

I'm not the only one.

-   [Google Search](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) doesn't render valid html.
-   Neither does [Facebook](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F)

Furthermore, within our jobs we're often given tasks from designs or user experiences which may ask us to break the standard html patterns. We work in browsers that will render a page that looks awesome anyway - so what's the whoop? It seems in the everyday developer environment Html doesn't _really_ matter. It's all about other things. ðŸ¤”

## How did html degradation happen?

When I started making websites as a profession, everything I did had to pass the [w3c test](https://validator.w3.org/). I remember using this tool to find unclosed element `<tags>` and fix layout issues. It was a standard thing to ask in job applications and put on a resume. Sure, there where a lot of `divs` but I could make a webpage render in Internet Explorer 6 _as expected_!

Then firefox became more popular, html5 elements became more supported and jQuery allowed us to do things without much thought as to what html was doing on a webpage. The iPhone came and Apps to a front seat. Everyone wanted an App and webpages to look like Apps so wether a webpage was valid or not didn't really seem to matter.

## The Rub

Now, years later, we know people don't go to many [webpages](https://www.quora.com/How-many-webpages-does-an-average-user-visit-per-day) and they don't use many [apps](http://fortune.com/2015/09/24/apps-smartphone-facebook/) so webpages have to be consumable for websites people _do_ go, usable for when people do get them and fast for when they _are_ viewed.

At this point I'm thinking, 'markup is maybe second most important part of a webpage' (behind content).

## What are some opportunities in better html?

Beyond the basics of high quality html,
-   Consumable
-   Usable
-   Fast

There are other opportunities to bullet proof awesome html.

**Usability**, I know I wrote it above but I just don't feel like a drove it home. ðŸ˜„ Html has patterns built into it that make content accessible in many formats. For people with disabilities to people using standard keys to go through a webpage - if html is done well people can navigate through your web experience better.

**CSS for free**, what? Yup, those css styles that most stylesheets override are there for a reason. I'm not fully sure, but I think that the more we right correct `html` the more we can inherit from those browser provided styles.

**Meaningful markup across teams**, we write css classes to define what things are but what if we knew our `html` tags and `attributes` is such a way that that we didn't depend on css classes. Rules could be set based on html semantics.

## Rant

Well, there are some - most tools have fallen aside to other tools for linting & checking if this are done well. What I'm saying is, there should be better tools for checking, understanding & writing html!

> There should be better tools for checking, understanding & writing html!

Think about how you use your phone or other tools on the internet. I'm gonna go out on a limb (but I don't think it's wrong) - the majority of what you consume is text, images & media & in a very plain way!

Developers and people of the like should be thinking this way, 'we need tools that get our text, images & media in consumer hands'. Valid, semantic html would seem to be a great way to do that.
