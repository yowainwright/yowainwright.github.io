Code Etiquette is not discussed with a quarter of the level of scrutiny that code is within the engineering community. Code etiquette affects learning, code quality, relationships, and self confidence. As code is logical in nature, it is easy to pin point code that is incorrect or could be improved. The human condition when looking at and discussing something that is logical (code), feelings get hurt and humans loose focus on learning and collaboration. This post boils down feelings mixing with discussing code to the words **code etiquette**.

Improving code etiquette, because of the human condition, is difficult.

Here is a quick list of things that I've done, said, seen, or received that are easier wins in the art of Code Etiquette.

## Remove the person

Without realizing it, often the difference between insightful critique and something that can seem like personal criticism is involving personal relationships in communication.

**You and I: ** Using you or I is probably not offensive intentially so don't worry. However, over time, involving the person _can_ start to feel less positive—especially if there are ever vocal tones added.

```md
You should return out of this loop early
```

**We:** Using _we_ is inclusive and it seems like a safe thing to say. However, if the person speaking says we, yet has not worked on the code at all, it may seem falsely inclusive. 

```md
we should return out of this loop early
```

**No personal reference:** Without personal reference, conversation or review will closely communicate to the problem, idea, or issue

```md
return out of this loop early
```


Notice how the amount of text needed to communicate the same thing is small and speaks clearly to the code only. This will help with human interaction, separate code discussion from personal discussion, and less words are need to communicate the exact same thing.

## Keep passionate conversations quiet

Passion is an important motivator for improving at things. Even passion when it is critical in nature can be very considerate and motivating. 

An important thing to remember when being passionate is taking on a quieter tone. This will cause people to get closer to listen and if passionate conversation is negative in nature—people won't worry about being embarassed.

## Don't point, ever

Pointing in almost any situation is not positive. It changes the focal point of the conversation from the conversation to a person or thing. Try to describe what is being discussed or lead verbally in the direction you would like to point at.

## You will probably never know if you've won or you were right

Developers almost always want to re-write things. It is natural to break down problems to tasks and the mentalities of the time. Putting focus on the who's and why's of product is time that should probably be spent learning and documenting the product

The above list are some simple high level things that I believe can really help with positive engagement when talking about code or technology. I am a hypocrite. I do all of the things that I've said not to do in the list above. I feel that my goal is not to be perfect but to develop a standard code etiquette to strive for. Much like code, etiquette when talking about code can always be improved. By setting up the notes above for myself, I have created benchmarks where I can naturally begin to assess my _code etiquette_.
