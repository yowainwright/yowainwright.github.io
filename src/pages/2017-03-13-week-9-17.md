This week was a humbling and emotional week for me. I feel more emotional and humbled after being sick but this week _the feels_ were deeper. I'm transitioning work teams, was reminiscing about my friend Lauren who passed away, and continued learning how to surf.

## Changing Teams

Changing teams is emotional for me. I put a lot into my work—all of myself for at least a full work day and usually after (by choice). Even though my teammates are usually still around I miss the experience of them working how we were. I grow attached to the ways that I was working. It's hard. Besides my working with my last team, there's always a learning curve with a new team and I feel unsure of myself because there I know there are a lot of things that I don't know. 

## Getting Back to Surfing

Being sick for a week and a half, I wasn't able to surf. I missed being in the water. I also want to improve. I still have a long ways to go to get to where I'd like to be surfing so time off is hard. 

I was able to get back in the water on Friday the 10th. I went to Venice and dropped in on a few smaller waves which is the main thing that I'm working on currently. 

I want to be able to drop in on waves better. I've been afraid of this part of surfing b/c I often eat shit when I try and swallow a bunch of water as well. It's not fun and swallowing a lot of water can lead to getting sick. 

On Saturday the 11th, I went to surf El Porto with my friend Justin but decided because of crowds that I would try a different spot. I went to Sunset and found that there were hardly any surfings and a bunch of 1-2ft waves—great for dropping in.

Sunday, the 12th, I surfed Venice. There were 1-4ft waves. They were a bit bigger than Sunset the day before which allowed me to test my drop-in training. I dropped in on what I think may have been a 3ft wave—probably my biggest drop-in. I dropped in on several more waves and swallowed water several times. I found myself wanting to push myself which I had not felt surfing yet but I'm embracing it. 

## Feeling Beta

A feeling that I was thinking through this week a lot was that of feeling beta. When I write _feeling beta_ I mean _feeling like I'm placing second in a lot of people's minds_. 

I was feeling beta because I was not feeling 100% and because there was language that was communicated to me this week that made me feel _less than_ the person that was communicating to me. 

I actually, within myself, like the feeling of _being beta_ once in a while. It tells me that my ego is motivated to improve. I'm looking forward improving in some places that I would like to. Also, the things that made me feel this way communicate to me that last week and future weeks will be a time of silent growth. 

It was a great week! I feel like I have a lot to look forward to over the next weeks. I have some things that I'm excited about learning and doing.
