Commercially, "just doing it" is clear in regards to chasing dreams and ideas. If a person has an dream, they should go for it! If a person has an idea, it should become a reality! There is little argument about _going for your dreams_ or _making ideas reality_. Furthermore, a reality is personified that with effort (more effort than everyone else), your dreams and ideas can happen! Reality is a bit more harsh. Not every dream comes true and not every idea is good one.

I've read articles about the reality of "just doing it" and the [harsh truth](http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/estimated-probability-competing-professional-athletics) that most dreams and ideas don't come into fruition. This post is _slightly_ different. This post is written with an awareness that there is only one [Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan) in basketball and no matter how hard millions of people have tried to be like "Mike, they don't attain that level of skill; not even close.

This post reflects on what happens when it is clear to person that they're not the best, excelling or even skilled at something and—they still just do it!

## Some people just do it despite there being no ryhme-or-reason

Yet, some people don't stop doing things. I see it every day on my neighborhood runs (something that I'm not that good at but don't stop doing). I pass by soccer fields and basketball courts full of people similar to me, dressed to a tee in sports gear, and preforming at a level that no one will every be impressed by. But why?

## The judgement of others

When we (humans) are young, we're encouraged to try new things, to learn as much as possible, and to explore as much as we safely can. As we grow older, society encourages us to conform and lock our focus into certain things.

## The comparision of self

When we're doing things that we're generally terrible at

## The enlightenment of doing something for joy

Isn't it cool that despite not having any skill, people "just do it"? To me, this is **so cool**. People are generally terrible at something but deep down inside, their that says, "Not stopping me. I'm gonna do this shit **way** more!". We (humans) gripe about taxes which take a few hours and most any of us can do. Yet, we find something that we love, are terrible, and frustrates us—and still do it **a lot**.
