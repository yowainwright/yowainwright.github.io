Commercially, "just doing it" is clear approach for chasing dreams and ideas. If a person has an dream, they should go for it! If a person has an idea, it should become a reality! There is little argument about "going for your dreams" or "making ideas reality".

Furthermore, through marketing commerce, reality is personified that with effort (more effort than everyone else), your dreams and ideas can happen! Reality is a way more harsh. Not every dream comes true and not every idea is good one. The universe seems to rejects ideas and dreams every chance it can get.

This article is not about the harsh truth of chasing dreams or that you indeed can chase your dreams and they will come true. No, this article is about people doing things even though it is clear what they're doing won't make dreams come true or ideas a reality.

## Some people "just do it" despite there being no ryhme-or-reason

Even though individuals, sometimes whole teams of individuals, have no skill, they don't stop doing things. I see it every day on neighborhood runs (something that I'm not that good at but don't stop doing). I pass by runners, soccer fields and basketball courts, and tennis courts full of people similar to me doing things poorly. Dressed to a tee in sports gear, and preforming at a level that no one will every be impressed by. But why?

Many individuals go further than this—beyond standard sports commonly found in communities. They drive boats poorly, make beer poorly, skateboard, or surf poorly—and these things named are still fairly standard activities. Individuals get into all sorts of weird S**t! It can seem like a joke to others. Yet, this doesn't stop us individuals. But why?

I'm getting to why I think "people "just do it" despite there being no ryhme-or-reason". Don't rush me!

## The judgement of others

Taking a brief look back at us humans as children, When we (humans) are young, we're encouraged to try new things, to learn as much as possible, and to explore as much as we safely can. As we grow older, society encourages us to conform and lock our focus into certain things. This is done through marketing stereotypes, community judgement. This article is going to go deep into how society tries to get individuals to conform; I just wanted to acknowledge it! In my conclusion I'll come back to this note.

## The comparision of self

When we're doing things that we're generally terrible at, it is easy to focus on others to really dig into our ego. Something about how it hurts feels like we want to do it way more. This point will also be followed up on in this articles conclusion. Another common saying related

## The enlightenment of doing something for joy

Isn't it cool that despite not having any skill, people "just do it"? To me, this is so cool. People are generally terrible at something but deep down inside, their that says, "Not stopping me. I'm gonna do this shit way more!". We (humans) gripe about taxes which take a few hours and most any of us can do. Yet, we find something that we love, are terrible, and frustrates us—and still do it a lot.
