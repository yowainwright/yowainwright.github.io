Yesterday, I turned 37. It seemed like only a few days ago that I was walking the streets of Pragueâ€”where I lived in high school. I often reflect on my time alive and realize that there are so many moments that have disappeared to me. I can live in a worm-hole of just a few seconds for years. I try to keep that in mind every day. I try to look for moments that will last and be productive during all of the time that doesn't matter much to me.
