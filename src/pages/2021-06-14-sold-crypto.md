Reality currently feels skewed. 
I've written a shortlist below with some key skewed current event items. 

---

1. Most of humanity is [working from home](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/05/19/work-home-covid-many-people-want-keep-working-remotely/5150568001/). 
1. Socialites are depressed and [introverts have never been better](https://www.pilotonline.com/life/vp-db-introverts-love-quarantine-05032020-20200503-ry4g5otucfehbmbnuve5xahhum-story.html). 
1. A barrel of oil was valued [below zero](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52350082). 
1. A car company with a small percentage of the market share holds [more stock market value other larger car companies combined](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/tesla-valuation-more-than-nine-largest-carmakers-combined-why.html). 
1. Individual investors have played some [successful short squeezes on hedge funds](https://www.moneycrashers.com/big-short-squeeze-retail-investors-wall-street/) creating excitement and chaos in the market.
1. Lastly, depending on the date, cryptocurrencies, which are [less effective at best then their standard competitors](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44), have together been valued at over two trillion dollars.

The shortlist above is why I researched and thought deeply about my stake in cryptocurrency. 
Eventually, my research and thoughts led me to sell my cryptocurrency. 
In the post, I'll explore why.

_**Note:** I'm not a financial professional. Generally speaking—you're investing will do better if you do the opposite of what I suggest. _

If you prefer to jump to my conclusion on why I sold my cryptocurrency [click here to jump down there](#why-I-sold-my-cryptocurrency-my-short-journey-into-speculative-bets-and-reversion). 

The next paragraphs describe how I got into cryptocurrency _and investing_. 
Much of my story about getting into cryptocurrency and investing is similar to many people during COVID. 
If anything is unique about my journey, its that this new passion led me to reconsider my saving practices.

## Learning about cryptocurrency (my journey is probably similar to yours)

In September, a friend of mine mentioned Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, had a high probability of going up in value over the next year.
His reasoning was Bitcoin had recently received institutional investment and ["The Bitcoin Halving"](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769) would lead to lots of momentum which would cause Bitcoin to got up in value over the course of the year (2020) and probably into 2021. 
I invested a responsible amount compared with my savings and investing allocation.

After holding Bitcoin for a few months it was up—way up! 
I felt like I was in on a secret watching Bitcoin jump thousands of dollars in a single day. 
It motived me to learn more about investing and saving. My friend again offered me sage advice.

> Have you heard of JL Collins? Have you heard of f**k you money? How about Mr Money Mustache?

I had not heard of [JL Collins](https://jlcollinsnh.com/) or his mentor, [John Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle).

Mr [Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) has created a body of work that I'm also interested in.

## Why I sold my cryptocurrency, my short journey into speculative bets and reversion

In this section I'll provide reasons why I sold my Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies. 
I am not a big risk taker and tend to approach risks from what could go wrong rather than what could go right.

### _Not_ to be an inflation hedge

For months I've heard, 
"Bitcoin is an inflation hedge", or, 
"Bitcoin is a store of value". 
I was sold on this commentary.

Well, [inflation _is_ here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-is-already-herefor-the-stuff-you-actually-want-to-buy-11601112630) and Bitcoin has dropped by 40%. 
There is debate around this drop in Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) value. Champions of crypto say it's because of [FUD](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/the-crypto-collapse-heres-whats-behind-bitcoins-sudden-drop.html). However, currently, cryptocurrencies are proving not to be an inflation hedge and their store of value is in question.

---

### A market cap of trillions

Before the current Cryptocurrency bear market, 
the cryptocurrency market cap was [trillions of dollars](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/)! 
Spokespeople for cryptocurrency readily claimed (some still do) that Bitcoin was going to 200k+ per bitcoin in 2021!
That would've put the cryptocurrency market cap at trillions which scares to me because the space feels very speculative.

---

### Cryptocurrencies compete against government interests

[Cryptocurrencies compete against government](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-15/cryptocurrencies-are-rising-so-are-the-stakes-for-governments) interest which is intriguing. 
However, when something goes against international interests there will be pushback. 
A large amount of pushback in a speculative unprotected asset is risky.

---

### Cryptocurrencies are largely unprotected by law

Unlike other investments, Cryptocurrency regulation often seems to not work technically.

---

### Transaction fees
