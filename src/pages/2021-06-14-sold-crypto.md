Reality currently feels skewed. 
I've written a shortlist below with some key skewed current event items. 

---

1. Most of humanity is [working from home](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/05/19/work-home-covid-many-people-want-keep-working-remotely/5150568001/). 
1. Socialites are depressed and [introverts have never been better](https://www.pilotonline.com/life/vp-db-introverts-love-quarantine-05032020-20200503-ry4g5otucfehbmbnuve5xahhum-story.html). 
1. A barrel of oil was valued [below zero](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52350082). 
1. A car company with a small percentage of the market share holds [more stock market value other larger car companies combined](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/tesla-valuation-more-than-nine-largest-carmakers-combined-why.html). 
1. Individual investors have played some [sucessful short squeezes on hedge funds](https://www.moneycrashers.com/big-short-squeeze-retail-investors-wall-street/) creating excitment and chaos in the market.
1. Lastly, depending on the date, cryptocurrencies, which are [less effective at best then their standard competitors](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44), have together been valued at over two trillion dollars.

The shortlist above is a large part of why I researched and thought deeply about my stake in cryptocurrency. 
Eventually, my research and thoughts led me to sell my cryptocurrency. 
In the post, I'll explore why.

_**Note:** I'm not a financial professional. Generally speaking—you're investing will do better if you do the opposite of what I suggest. _

If you'd prefer to jump to my conclusions about why I sold my cryptocurrency [click here to jump down there](#why-I-sold-my-cryptocurrency-my-short-journey-into-speculative-bets-and-reversion). 

The next paragraphs describe how I got into cryptocurrency _and investing_. 
I totally realize much of my story about getting into cryptocurrency and investing is similar to many people during COVID. 
If anything is unique about my journey, its that this new passion lead me to reconsider my saving practices.

## Learning about cryptocurrency (my journey is probably similar to yours)

In September, friend of mine mentioned Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, had a high probability of going up in value over the next year.
He mentioned that because of institutional investment and ["The Bitcoin Halving"](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769) that Bitcoin was like to go up over the course of the year (2020) and probably into 2021. 
I invested a resposible amount compared with my savings and investing allocation after doing about 5 minutes of research. I think I watched a Youtube video or 2 and maybe read a blog post.

_My friends advice opened up a new passion for me—reading about investing—the company's,_
_what cryptocurrences and what do they proivde,_
_how the economy works,_
_and how individual saving and investing works._
_I really enjoy reading about investing still._
_I'm motivated to learn more about the world and look for opportunities to save._

_Maybe I'll share more about this later but back to my crypto post!_

---

After holding Bitcoin for a few months I observed I was up—way up! 
I felt like I was in on some secret as I watch Bitcoin jump thousands of dollars. 
This motived me to learn more about investing. My friend again offered me sage advice.

## Why I sold my cryptocurrency, my short journey into speculative bets and reversion

in this section I'll go over why I sold my Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies (besides Cardano). 

### Bitcoin is proving itself not to be an inflation hedge

For months and even now I've heard, 
"Bitcoin is an inflation hedge", or, 
"Bitcoin is a store of value". 
I was really sold on this commentary and can reflect on boring dialogues led by me where I profecised those comments.

Well, [inflation _is_ here]() and Bitcoin has dropped by 40%. 
I know there is a lot of debate around this drop in Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) value but facts are facts.
Currently, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are clearly not inflation hedges.

### Trillions of dollars market caps for unproven and unused technologies

Before the current Cryptocurrency bear market, 
the cryptocurrencies market cap was trillions of dollars.

---

_Trillions of dollars of what?_
_What do these cryptocurrencies do? Are they helping anyone?_

---

The answer to these questions is they do nothing practical that can't be done way better by something else! 
I am open to speculation in many things, maybe even investing. 
But, at the trillions of dollars worth of market value? 

### Cryptocurrencies compete against government interests

### Cryptocurrencies are largely unprotected by law

### What am I investing in when I'm investing in Cryptocurrencies
