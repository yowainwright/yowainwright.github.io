[Document Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie) is a part of the HTML Document. It's used on many, if not most, websites to store data.
Although, `document.cookie` is a string, there are subtle nuances to its API which can be misunderstood.
In this article, these nuances are explored in _just enough_ detail to, hopefully, make `document.cookie` even more understandable.

## The Basics of Document Cookie

Cookies can be created or referenced via the `document.cookie` property.

To create a cookie, all that is needed is something very simple.

```javascript
document.cookie = '<key>=<value>;';
```

Reading cookies is very simple as well.

```javascript
const cookies = new UrlSearchParams(document.cookie);
cookies.get('<key>');
```

## Cookie Attributes Are Write Only (Nuance 1)

After reading "The Basics of Document Cookie" section above, Cookies are incredibly simple to understand.
However, if viewing [MDN's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie) description of `document.cookie`, you'll notice attributes can be added to a cookie to control its behavior.
This concept is easy to understand. However, when viewing the API for adding attributes, it's slightly more confusing.

```javascript
document.cookie = '<key1>=value1; expires=<date1>; path=<path>; domain=<domain>; secure; httponly';
document.cookie = '<key2>=value2; expires=<dat2>; path=<path>;secure; httponly';
const cookies = new UrlSearchParams(document.cookie);
Object.fromEntries(cookies); // { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' }
```

### Code Observations

- When reading the cookie output, all attributes are removed
- Each cookie only has an accessible `key` and `value`

### Browser Observation

- Cookie attributes can be viewed in the browser only!

---

## Cookie Updates (Nuance 2)

Hint, a Cookie cannot be updated. It can only be re-written!
The good news is that because a cookie is only a string containing a key and value separated by a `=`, it is easy to find a replace with code.

Lets see this in in action!

```javascript
const cookies = new UrlSearchParams(document.cookie); // '<key1>=<value`>;<key2>=<value2>;'
cookies.set('<key>', '<value>');
// note: when adding attributes the code  to update a cookie is slightly more complex
```

### Code Observation

- Cookies can't be updated. They can be re-written!
- It is important to remember when re-writing a cookie to set necessary attributes!
- It is important when designing the tech spec of a cookie to plan for attributes being write-only!

### Browser Obverations

- When viewing `cookies` assigned to `document.cookie` in a string, `attributes` are removed
- Cookie key and value pairs are separated by a `=` within the `cookies` string.
- Cookies are separated by a `;` with the `cookies` string

---

## Multiple Cookies (Nuance 3)

When assigning a cookie, attributes are added with the same value as the key and value pair `=`, and `;`.
Weirdly, when retrieving cookies, each cookie represented by a key and value pair is also seperated by a `=`, and a `;`.

```javascript
document.cookie = '<key1>=<value1>; expires=<date1>; path=<path>; domain=<domain>; secure; httponly';
document.cookie; // '<key1>=<value1>;'
```

### Code Observation

- Don't worry about creating a cookie string with attributes and not being able to filter it among cookies and attributes!
- Do worry about writing tech spec which accounts for expires to only be re-written, not updated!
- Remember cookie keys are are unique, in that if you assign a cookie with the same key, it will overwrite the other cookie!

## Final thoughts

Cookies are a very simple useful way to store data.
The fact that they are write-only and can't be updated is important to understand.
Once those 2 points are understood, using cookies should be fun and generally easy.
Lastely, attributes are valuable for managing cookie behavior and keeping them secure!
Just remember they're only viewable in a browser's dev tools.

Before writing this post, I did get caught up in the nuances I have tried to describe in this article.
I always used [js-cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) or similar so the nuances of `document.cookie` were hidden.
I wrote this simple utility, [mini-cookies](https://github.com/yowainwright/mini-cookies) with 0 dependencies to abstract these nuacesâ€”but in a very mimimal way.
Please reach out if you have suggestions!

Happy Hacking!
