Normalizing CSS has been part of building front-end product for years. The last few projects I've worked on, I've become adverse to normalization CSS files but ha not clarified why for myself or others. In this post, I will go into what CSS normalization is, why it is used, and why it might not be needed.  

[CSS Normalization](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is a concept of defining CSS property values so that a web pages styles behave and look consistent across web browsers, like Internet Explorer, FireFox, Safari, and Chrome **before** adding styles to the CSS. that gained moment back in 2012 by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://twitter.com/necolas) and [Jon Neal](https://twitter.com/jon_neal). 

## What does this do for web projects?
-  makes basic element styles the same across web browsers before more styles are added. 
-  defines a standard to start with when working on a new project
-  makes your outputted `.css` bigger
-  provides basic support for random design notes from your grandmother who uses Internet Explorer and want to view all of the table layouts you're making

## What does this _not_ do for web projects?

-  does not prevent other cross-browser hacks that are added to the CSS Cascade after normalization
-  does not define usable styles for your projectâ€”it is not a CSS framework
-  does not provide browser hacks to normalization your CSS
-  does not protect a project's CSS from un-normalizing itself
-  does not love you like your grandmother does and will not accept that you are defining overriding styles until you trump its styles or use something like [purify CSS](https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss)

## Why would someone use Normalization?

CSS Normalization gives developers a safe starting point at which to know styles are the same across browsers. For projects where an element inventory is not looked after regularly or, perhaps if there are very very few styles, CSS Normalize can guarantee normality of elements before any custom styling is done.

#### A quick example of how

In this code, browser one will have a preset h1 defined `font-size` of `3rem`

```css
elementExample {
  font-size: 3rem;
}
```

Browser 2 will have a preset h1 defined `font-size` of `2.5rem`

```css
elementExample {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
}
```

When `normalize.css` is included at the top of a CSS project, it will ensure all `elements`'s have a font size `2rem` until overridden. 

```css
elementExample {
  font-size: 2em;
}
```


As long as the `font-size` is not changed, the `font-size` will be consistent across all browsers.

```css
elementExample {
  text-style: italic;
}
```

## Why I have not used CSS Normalization for a long time?

#### 1. Normalize.css is additive

Browsers provide CSS. `Normalize.css` adds duplicate CSS rules or overrides CSS rules provided by the browser.

In this code, by default, the `font-size` is `3rem`.

```css
elementExample {
  font-size: 3rem;
}
```

`Normalize.css` re-declares the `font-size` is as `3rem`.

```css
elementExample {
  font-size: 3rem;
}
```


Then if the `font-size` is declared for the actual project, `elementExamples`'s CSS has already been re-defined three times.

```css
elementExample {
  font-size: 3rem;
}
```


#### 2. Projects will override the Normalize.css CSS

Browsers come with CSS styles baked in that declare how HTML elements should look. Older browsers need a lot of normalization help. Newer browsers don't need as many CSS Normalization styles, yet styles added to insure that styles are the same across browsers. When custom styles are added, they will quickly over-ride normalized styles. 


In this code, by default, the `font-size` is `3rem`.

```css
elementExample {
  font-size: 3rem;
}
```

`normalize.css` will change the `font-size` to `2.5rem`.

```css
elementExample {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
}
```

Then, if the developer defines `font-size` again, without much CSS, `elementExamples`'s CSS has already been defined and overruled three times.

```css
elementExample {
  font-size: 2em;
}
````


#### 3. If there is a slim element Inventory, styles will be added for elements that aren't used

`Normalize.css` provides CSS that normalizes CSS for **all** elements.

If a project only uses three elements and normalize CSS provides six element styles, then there will be CSS rules defined for two extra elements.


In this code, there are three defined styles

```css
elementExample1 {
  display: block;
}
elementExample2 {
  display: inline-block;
}
elementExample3 {
  display: inline;
}

```


The project only uses `elementExample`
```html
<elementExample1></elementExample1>
```

`Normalize.css` styles added for `elementExample2` and `elementExample3` will be unused.

The project only uses `elementExample`
```html
<elementExample1></elementExample1>
```

## Conclusion

`Normalize.css` is a great tool that was relied on for a long time. Now, it is still an important source for defining CSS style standards. It may not need to be included in all projects. 

---

When considering adding `Normalize` to your next library:

-  make a general HTML element inventory in your head
-  decide if a CSS framework tool will be used
-  think about the audience that will be reached

If these things are not documented, or they're difficult to think of, adding `Normalize.css` in 2017 might slow you down in more ways than one.
