I stopped posting on this blog in September last year, 2017. It was an easy decision to make then. There were specific reasons I stopped, but I couldn't articulate them. In this post, I'm going to articulate why I stopped posting.

## Find meaning in the meaningless—a long-winded side-step to this post's point

My living parents are diplomats. They travel around the world. When I tell people about their work and my childhood, people say something like, "What a cool life to live!". They're right. It was cool. However, my parents' lives and work always came before my life.

Until my mid-thirties, I had no idea who I was. I felt no value. Then when I turned 33, I started on a journey of learning to love myself. It felt as cheesy as it sounds. People would often observe that I was overly positive. I seemed fake. I would often subconsciously say, "Fake it until you make it!".

My first inclination to learn to love myself was to find someone else to love me. I failed miserably. Looking back, it's gotta be hard to love someone who has no idea who they are, seems fake, and is having conversations with themselves—"Fake it until you make it!".

My second inclination to learn to love myself was by letting go of memories that made me not love myself. I road thousands of miles on a bicycle—mostly in solitude. I sometimes cried on the road. I got upset sometimes. I told myself, "All of your pain—put it on the road!". I was able to let old emotions go, and I did find a part of myself that I didn't know before. It wasn't what I expected. I imagined my journey would matter to others. It didn't. It was my journey. It only mattered to me. Besides letting go, while riding my bike in wilderness I saw so much beauty. By letting go of emotions and enjoying beautiful solitude, I had more to give when I was around people.

After getting injured cycling, I felt done with escape activities. I felt acceptance of myself. I felt aware of personality traits. Some traits I need to improve and I have some strengths. I came up with a few slogans for myself—my truths: "I'm a disciplined person who surrounds himself with thoughtful truth. I'm dedicated, satisfied, and want to feel good. I listen and confront problems when needed even if hard.".

## Okay, here's why I stopped writing post and I'm starting again

Here's why I stopped writing posts: last August, I realized that the respect I hoped for through my dedication to design, exercise, and software might never come.

I had felt for a while that my posts were like whispers in the wind. It was tough to realize that. That fantasy that had motivated me since childhood, that someday my dedication would matter to a wider audience, needed to be let go. I somewhat secretly hoped that the invisibility I felt in reality, was a case of circumstance. I fantasied that through effort in my passions that I would find a clan where my ideas would matter.

Disheartened that I might never have a clan and that my journey (writen about in paragraphs above) to loving myself did not lead me to more friendship, love, fame, or riches, I stopped posting.

## Well, why am I writing this post now

After accepting that posts I was writing may not ever help find a clan or reach a wider audience, I decided to find excitement and passion in others' writing, videos, and work. I would add updates to this site to keep up with technologies, but that was it!
Months went by without writing posts. I was able to maintain excitement about my passions and have acceptance about my lack of clan. I think that was another phase of loving myself—loving myself in loniliness.

I realized, though, that I lost my context when I stopped posting. My context helps me to learn, maintain timelines for my memories, and retain what I've learned! So, I am posting again! My goal is to keep my posts a little longer than a tweet with information about my life and/or my learnings. That's it!
