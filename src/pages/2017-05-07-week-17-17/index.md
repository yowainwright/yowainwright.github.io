While skateboarding hard during my young adult life, my ankles were not treated the best. Now, well into my thirties, I sometimes have extended ankle problems after minor injuries—like stubbing my foot. This happened this week so I wasn't able to do much exercise. At work, I built an observer to try to fix a race condition we've been dealing with in our analytics tool since before I started. Today, Sunday, my ankle felt good enough that I could go on a long walk and I did—in the snow, just above Los Angeles.
