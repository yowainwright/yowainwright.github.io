Over the last few weeks, I've been laying low. I'm wrapping up a rewriting to better support customers for [Stickybits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits). I'm finishing up 2 new open source repositories.  I've also been really impressed by a few projects at work and have learned a lot from them. Outside of work, I have a rib injury so no surfing but more [running a bike riding](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335).

Stickybits has been more challenging than out open source products I've worked on. This is because which has multiple ways of failing. Issues can be app related or browser related. The majority of app issues are because of pagination. When a customer clicks from 1 area to another without awareness of where the sticky item is in relationship to the top of the window. Browser issues are more tricky. Net-net, the re-write of Stickybits will expose the API more. It will allow the engineer customer to control stickybits more. The re-write will also test most lines of code. My hope is after this re-write, issues will be able to be fixed faster and enginer customers will be able to manage the tool better for themselves.

My 2 open source projects are the result of learning, I am excited to share more when they're done. I've been getting into learning Go as well continuing to grow my understanding of JavaScript. 

This week, I was able to understand a tool that some of my teammates built. The tool quickly configures new repositories and updates repositories. Tooling have become increasingly complex. So getting into understanding this tool has been worth while.

Outside of code related stuff, I've been running and riding my bike a lot. It's been fun to be able to slowly get back into running after an ankle injury that I'm recovering from now. 

Until next week, Jeff.
