I'm getting to this post a bit late—1 week. Why? I switched teams at work. I'm now be working on an analytics product. 

## Working on Analytics

I'm very happy to working on building an analytics tool for my company. The tool will take in information as a customer navigates our sites and turn that information into a uniform data object that can be used by various analytics platforms like Adobe, Looker or Google Analytics.
