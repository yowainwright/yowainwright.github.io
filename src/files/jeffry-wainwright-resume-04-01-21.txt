As a Senior Software Engineer, I specialize in frontend applications and build pipelines. 
Since stepping into Software Engineering Management, my focus is code re-usability and standards. 
I aim to keep products simple and tested—except for the “special sauce” that makes a great product exceptional. 
I seek roles where I can be a team’s momentum multiplier while building products that make businesses happy and customers even happier.
