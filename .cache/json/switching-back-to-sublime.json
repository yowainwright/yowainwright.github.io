            "html": "<p>The majority of people on the Frontend Team in my current use <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> as a text editor. To more closely mimic my team, I decided to make the switch from Sublime 3 (another text editor) to Atom.</p>\n<h2>Initial Feelings</h2>\n<p>My initial take on Atom was that beautifulâ€”more beautiful out-of-the-box than Sublime and I liked that. I started to invest time learning quick keys. Over time, I noticed that Sublime had out of the box features that were not available with Atomâ€”like drag-and-drop.  Avoiding dragging is important but for *<em>1 thing</em> I do a lot I couldnâ€™t find a solution and dragging seems easier for me. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>*RE: 1 thing: With an Atom Window open I could not figure out a way to drag-and-drop a new project folder into its sidebar. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Beyond that, I found Atom to be slow and a memory hog. Iâ€™ve heard the debate that Sublime can become slow when a lot of plugins are added but Iâ€™ve never seen or felt that. </p>\n<h2>I am more productive with Sublime</h2>\n<p>After a few months of feeling like I wasnâ€™t as productive with Atom, I decided to switch back to Sublime. I started re-learning my quick keys and then looking into some of the features that I liked about Atomâ€”to see if I could add them with a plugin in Sublime.</p>\n<h2>Making Sublime as beauitful as Atom</h2>\n<p>I love Atomâ€™s out of the box beauty. Iâ€™ve found that it only takes a few minutes to get Sublime to take on the features I enjoy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>File Icons: I doubt that file icons came with Atom but thatâ€™s were I first saw them. With the plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/ihodev/a-file-icon\">a-file-icon</a> I was able to achieve that. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new app icon: even though I personally didnâ€™t mind the Sublime icons there are some out there that just great. I updated the Sublime App icon with this great <a href=\"https://github.com/YabataDesign/sublime-text-icon\">replacement</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/YabataDesign\">JosÃ© MarÃ­a Clemente</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A sweet font: watching <a href=\"http://wesbos.com/\">Wes Bosâ€™s</a> videos caused me to wonder about that awesome font he uses (<a href=\"https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator\">Operator</a>) as an editor font. I donâ€™t have the $270 for Operator on my home and work computer so I went with a another recommendation from <a href=\"http://wesbos.com/programming-fonts/\">him</a> called <a href=\"http://www.fontspace.com/m-fonts/m-2m\">m-2m</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Adding things I liked from Atom to Sublime</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For adding file icons, and an awesome them I went to the sublime package manager and downloaded them. I recommend the <a href=\"https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme\">material theme</a> b/c I it transitions between regular and italic fonts and has a nice sweet of supporting featuresâ€”linke icons for files.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sublime Text > Preferences > Package Control</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For adding a new app icons, I went <a href=\"https://github.com/YabataDesign/sublime-text-icon\">here</a> and followed the steps</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>click download</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>open /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/Resources/</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>replace Sublime Text.icns</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>right click on the Sublime Text App > select â€˜get infoâ€™</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>drag the downloaded â€˜Sublime Text.icnsâ€™ over the deafult icon in the top left corner</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For changing the font, first I downloaded a font, <a href=\"http://www.fontspace.com/m-fonts/m-2m\">m-2m</a>. Then I updated my Sublime Settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>download and install the font</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sublime Text (nav) > Preferences > Settings </p>\n<p><strong>Hereâ€™s the JSON:</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n<span class=\"token string\">\"font_face\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mplus-2m-medium\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"font_options\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"gray_antialias\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"subpixel_antialias\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"font_size\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">17.0</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Atom is great. I really like how it is built but I like Sublime more for. Itâ€™s easy to get caught up in the churn of trying new tools. Iâ€™m glad I went back to Sublime because it is still just the best (for me right now). ðŸ’›</p>",
