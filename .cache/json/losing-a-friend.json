            "html": "<p>Lauren and I met through a mutual friend of ours from Chicago. When she arrived in Manhattan Beach, where I lived, we became fast friends. At the time, I was recovering from a serious bout with Pneumonia. The sickness had left me a bit depressed. She was going through some life changes making us the perfect travel/hang-out duo.\n{: .first-paragraph}</p>\n<p>After meeting, we immediately discussed politics and history. Normal stuff, right? 😂 She was passionate about certain things, like Cuba. These certain things she could describe in great detail which I enjoyed listening to for hours. We enjoyed debating certain points. I learned a from her responses. </p>\n<p>She had a lot to say about several television shows, like Game of Throwns and Bob’s Burgers. I know many people watch a lot of television shows—but not like Lauren. She could converse, debate and laugh about each episode of a show she watched in detail. I would watch shows just to connect the dots of the stories Lauren would tell about shows. </p>\n<p>The first trip that she roped me into was from Chicago to Orlando in the dead of winter. I don’t know why she asked me to go but we went. We left Chicago in a blizzard and I remember thinking, ‘This is a horrible idea! Why am I doing this?‘. We stopped in Memphis and listened to blues before heading further South—to the Gulf of Mexico. </p>\n<p>I remember arrving to the Gulf of Mexico and asking if we could watch the sunset from the Gulf. We went to an old lighthouse. The water was so calm; much more calm than I ever see in the Pacific. Lauren walked to shore facing the sun as it set> She buckled her knees (as she would) and crossed her arms. She looked almost mad at first. Then she took in a deep breath and it seemed that her whole body melted in view. It was the best sunset. At that moment, I was so glad I was on that trip. After, I arriving in Orlando I assumed I wouldn’t see her again. She had made plans to be a teacher abroad in Doha. </p>\n<p>A few weeks later, she reached out with a request to drive to Big Sur—a place she had wanted to go to and a favorite place of mine. She came back to California and we drove up the coast staying in Santa Barbara, Monterey, and Morro Bay. It was a memorable trip. Lauren left to teach in Doha after. </p>\n<p>Lauren and I would touch base after she moved to Doha—to reflect on our trips, what was up in our lives and reminisce a bit about fun times we’d had. She’d seemed well and that made me happy. I felt like we’d grown so much together. For myself, I’d learned how to live my life outside of who I’d been before Pneumonia. The new me was a bit more accepting of myself and I am thankful for what I learned from Lauren. I felt a stronger desire to just-enjoy-stuff and accept the people I care about for who the are ·and were. </p>\n<p>I’ll never forget Lauren for that and our trips. She will live on in my mind; appreciating sunsets—accepting a landscape so much that she seems to become a part of it, like that moment at the Gulf of Mexico. She will be missed. I’ll always see a bit of her in every sunset I watch—its quite good-bye mixed with fiery light. I’ll miss you Lauren Schlueter. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/losing-a-friend/gulf-of-mexico.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Lauren at the Gulf of Mexico\" />\n</figure>",
