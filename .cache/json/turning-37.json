I often times reflect on my time alive and realize that there are so many moments that have disappeared to me. Yet, I can live in a worm-hole of just a few seconds for years. I try to keep that in mind everyday. I try to look for moments that will last and be productive during all of the time that doesn’t matter much to me.  </p>",
