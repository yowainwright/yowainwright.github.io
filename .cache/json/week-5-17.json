Outside of tech, I had some good runs and spent some time at Leo Carillo Beach.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-5/leo-carillo-stream.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Leo Carillo Rock and Stream at Leo Carillo State Beach in California.\" />\n</figure>\n<h2>Updating Analytics</h2>\n<p>Analytics for the site I'm working on had a straightworward facelift. Or teams are also working on tool to make analytics more uniform across our web properties. </p>\n<h2>Fitness Work</h2>\n<p>I wasn't able to surf as much because of continued rain. I made it to the rock gym a few times and my aparment gym a few more times. I got onto my bike and ran for a few <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201705&#x26;interval_type=week&#x26;chart_type=miles&#x26;year_offset=0\">hours</a> as well. </p>\n<h2>Leo Cabrillo State Beach</h2>\n<p>Driving by Leo Cabrillo State Beach on Highway 1 has always been enjoyable. There's a rock that juts out from the ocean and appears to be battling longboarder waves 24 hours a day. Also, if there's been any rain, a stream flows out into the ocean. These are nice features of a beach. I had never really explored the beach beyond these observations though. I did that this week. Just north of the rocks and stream that is observable from highway are a few rock caves. The whole scene—the waves, the stream and the rock cave are memorable. I'm very glad I went.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-5/leo-carillo-cave.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Looking through a rock cave at Leo Carillo State Beach in California.\" />\n</figure>",
