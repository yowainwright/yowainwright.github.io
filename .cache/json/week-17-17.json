Now, well into my thirties, I sometimes have extended ankle problems after minor injuries—like stubbing my foot. This happened this week so I wasn’t able to do much exercise. At work, I built an observer to try to fix a race condition we’ve been dealing with in our analytics tool since before I started. Today, Sunday, my ankle felt good enough that I could go on a long walk and I did—in the snow, just above Los Angeles.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-17/portrait.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Ruby Beach\" />\n</figure>",
