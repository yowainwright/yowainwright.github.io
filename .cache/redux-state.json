You expect a mall to have stores for shoes, stores for electronics & potentially restaurants for food after you've become hungry from going to a bunch of stores.\n\nJavascript scope can be viewed like a mall. We could say that the mall is _global_ or that it is the _global scope_ which means that you can access all that the mall has to offer. However, people, or me at least, don't go to a mall for to walk around in it's large amount of space, we go for stores with specific it's at specialized stores.\n\nWe can consider these specialized stores the _local scope_ which means that when we go to 'a shoe store' we have access to shoes there but not food & when we go to a restaurant, we have access to food but not shoes.\n\nWhen we go into that shoe store, we're still at the mall & can get certain information from the mall - like that awesome mall music but we also have access to shoes (but not food). This idea is known as _Lexical Scope_. So Lexical Scope deals with where information can be accessed.\n\nAs we go around to these stores & purchase things, eating food & interacting with people at the mall while listening to that awesome mall music we're attaining 'stuff'. We're getting information from the music, perhaps purchasing goods from the store. We can think of that as the _Execution Context_. Execution Context is essentially, all of the stuff that we comes with & happens to us as we go there the mall. We keep the items that buy but, hopefully, forget some of the music that we listen to.\n\n## Now, Scope, seriously\n\nTo understand **scope**, we need to know about variables & how we store information. **[Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)** store bits of information in the key words _var_, _**[let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)**_, or _**[const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)**_. Const store a read only bit of information which means the information can’t be re-assigned. I will not be discussing _const_ anymore right now so forget I brought it up. _Let_ is very similar to _var_ to the point that I had to [find](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/let-keyword-vs-var-keyword) the difference: var is scoped to the nearest function scope which let is enclosed to the nearest closing block.\n\nScope, in Javascript, refers to where stored information can be accessed.\n\n**4 commonly talked about scopes are:**\n\n- Lexical Scope\n- Global Scope\n- Local Scope\n- Execution Context\n\n## Lexical Scope\n\n[Lexical](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/lexical-scoping-static-scoping) Scope refers to where a variables can be accessed within code blocks.\n\n## Global Scope\n\n**Global** Scope means that a variable was declared outside of a function so it can be accessed & modified throughout a program.\n\n## Local Scope\n\nLocal Scope refers the a variable that was declared within a function which means mean that it can only be accessed within that function.\n\n**example:**\n```javascript\n\nvar globalVar = ‘This var is global’;\nvar myFunc = function() {\n     var localVar = ‘This var is local’;\n};\n```\n\n## Execution Context\n\nExecution context is memory scope. It’s created as a program runs.\n\n\n**A fun example which demonstrates scope:**\n```javascript\n\nvar makeArray = function() {\n    return [];\n};\nvar array1 = makeArray();\nvar array2 = makeArray();\n\nconsole.log(array1 === array2); // returns false\n// it returns false b/c array1 & array2 are 2 different array objects\n// they have 2 different execution contexts\n\nconsole.log(array1 == array2); // also, returns false\n// == still returns false because the do not refer to the same object\n// http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3 (1.f.)\n```\n\nJavascript Scope, like a mall, is essential. It's great walking through the mall but you're not at Walmart. You want specialized items. You can walk around the mall & hear that mall music. That's The Global Scope. You don't want to go into a Footlocker to get shoes & walk out with a taco. You don't go to Taco Bell to get the new J's but if you could for the price of a taco - that'd be cool. Where you're able to go to purchase shoes or a taco - that's Lexical Scope. Anything that you buy or other interactions that happen as you go through the mall can be remembered as the execution context.\n",

We both decided that I should post an image of _Lemonade_ on Facebook to acknowledge what we had overcome: Turning Lemons to Lemonade.\n\n![Image of the painting the day of](https://yowainwright.imgix.net/art-lived/art-lived-start.jpg)\n\nNeedless to say - I did not follow through with my promise to post an image of _Lemonade_ on Facebook and this is the story of why.\n\nFirst, let me prefice the story with a brief timeline:\n\n1. Conversation with my friend,\n2. Planned posting of the Lemonade image until\n3. The incident described below happened.\n\n> A gentleman walks by _looking down on his luck_ and says, 'your lucky ... flats can be fixed!'\n\n![Image of my tire after getting a flat off the CA 10](https://yowainwright.imgix.net/art-lived/art-lived-tire.jpg)\n\nI was in Venice 2 weekends ago working on stuff with the founders of this new clothing company and one of the founders just happened to have this beautiful painting sitting out in their lawn. I took the sec to say, 'Wow! That painting is beautiful!'. Little did I know that this statement would lead to a wild night and early morning!\n\nAs I was leaving after a day of _data planning_ the owner of the painting says, 'bet that painting would look great on a wall in your house!'. I agreed and we decided to wrap the painting in cloth & tie to my car safe and sound ... Right? Wrong! I was driving on the 10 (Los Angeles Area Highway towards Downtown LA (where I currently live) and suddenly _Whoosh_. The painting was flying through the air. I was initially scared that it was going to cause problems but it landed flat on the front of a semi & immediately looked to explode.\n\n![Image of the painting after being hit](https://yowainwright.imgix.net/art-lived/art-lived-broken.jpg)\n\nWhen I got home, I called the person that had given me the painting & told him what happened. We sat on opposite ends of the phone silently for a sec. Then he goes, 'Do you remember where on the highway the painting flew off?'. Yup (I knew)! He says, 'Come get me!'. I go and pick him up & we go searching for the painting on the 10 [again, Los Angeles Highway (always busy)] & there it is sitting on the side of the Freeway. It might as well have been folded it was so perfect. We pull over & pick up the painting. As we are driving to the highway exit we hear a _whoop whoop whoop_. I had a flat tire. One of the wood chips from the painting's frame had lodged itself right into my tire. The tire was flatten almost immediately.\n\nSo there we were fixing a flat at about 3am on _Crenshaw_. Crenshaw is not the safest spot in LA to fix a flat. A gentleman walks by _looking down on his luck_ & says, 'your lucky ... flats can be fixed!'. He was right. I drove the owner of the painting home & before we bid our good byes he unfolded the painting & we looked at it - still beautiful. Art, for the night, lived!\n\nAfter scrambling to get my car fixed & other obligations, I didn't have time for the _lemonade_ picture post on Facebook but somehow I hoped that after sharing this story - it doesn't matter. I think that recovering the painting was actually a better symbol & I hope that my friend feels the same.\n\n![Image of the painting after being rebuilt](https://yowainwright.imgix.net/art-lived/art-lived-finished2.jpg)\n",

I quickly implemented it using [Glide JS](http://jedrzejchalubek.com/glide/) which fits in nicely with [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) (the framework I use on this site). This post describes my implementation.\n\nMany people don't like carousels and I _somewhat_ agree. Image carousels like the on above can be somewhat intruding to the content and are very often un-touched or swiped through by users. However, with a mobile first User Interface a carousel can be designed to act more as a swipe and can introduce an interesting way to present content.\n\nGood imagery with clean verbage can get a user to go through a carousel or can used to create a _side swipe_ as demonstrated here. Notice how im my _Reference Rolex_ a user can swipe or click from the side to view new content rather than to continue to scroll down. This, from my perspective, becomes most effective and relavant for users on a mobile view where swiping is more standard.\n\n**The CSS used**\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/0.12.0/css/semantic.min.css\"/>\n```\n\n**The JS used**\n```javascript\n<script src=\"//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/0.12.0/javascript<ntic.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.glide/1.0.6/jquery.glide.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**The html**\n\nThe HTML for the first 2 slides\n```html\n<div class=\"slider slider1\">\n  <div class=\"slides\">\n    <div class=\"slide-item item1\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"slide-item item2\"> \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"slide-item item3\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"slide-item item4\">\n    </div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**The JS added locally**\n\nJust call glide to run in your local JS\n```javascript\n$('.slider').glide();\n```\n\nNote: my JS for glide is slightly different but this is all you need.\n\n<div class=\"code-sample\">\n\t<p styles=\"min-height: 300px;\" data-height=\"268\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"71fdafe5e8fdae857086e9be2bd928ba\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"yowainwright\" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/71fdafe5e8fdae857086e9be2bd928ba/'>71fdafe5e8fdae857086e9be2bd928ba</a> by Jeff Wainwright (<a href='http://codepen.io/yowainwright'>@yowainwright</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>\n\t<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n</div>\n",

IT IS THAT SIMPLE! But, understanding why they’re so important quickly become pretty complex.\n\n## JavaScript Closure by Example\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind when I try to think of an example to explain Javascript Closures is the process of microwaving. When we put something, food preferably, in a microwave, we're expecting something tasty to come out after a few minutes. Well, maybe not tasty but definitely different.\n\nWe can think of a Javascript Closure like a microwave. There's an outer function, a chunk of re-usable code, which is represented by a microwave & an inner function which we could think of as the 'thingy' that cooks the food. \n\nWe don't want whatever is cooking that food, to cook us, so we put the food in the microwave (outer function) & then the actual 'thingy' that cooks the food (inner function). That encapsulated process that cooks the food is what & why we use a function.\n\nClosures are important because:\n- They can create private variables\n- They have access to functions & variables of a higher scope\n- They’re useful with time interval functions\n\n## Gettin' more serious about Closures\n\nJavascript Closure is created when an inner function is made accessible from outside of it’s parent function. This is commonly done by returning the inner function. So like when you put food into the microwave & then get it out.\n\n**Examples**\n```javascript\n// What are Closures?\nvar closureFunction = 'Closer are functions ';\nvar rememberWhat = 'that remember ';\nvar theirEnvironment = 'the environment there were created in. ';\n\nvar aVar = closureFunction;\nvar bVar = rememberWhat;\nvar cVar = theirEnvironment;\n\n// let's make some sentences tat describe closure\nvar varA = aVar;\nvar anArray = [];\nvar outerFunction = function() {\n  var varB = bVar;\n  anArray.push( function() {\n    var varC = cVar;\n   document.write(varA + varB + varC);\n  });\n};\nouterFunction();\nanArray[0]();\n\nvar varA = 'Private variables ';\nvar bVar = 'can be accessed ';\nvar cVar = 'with closure. ';\nouterFunction();\n//anArray[0](); //Uncomment & look at the sentence (not good - that is not correct)\nanArray[1]();\n```\nView the [live code](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/d9926371f494ac0809bb8805d73575d8) sample.\n\n**& another super basic dive into Javascript closure:**\n```javascript\nvar myFunc = function() {\n  var myOtherFunc = function() {\n    document.write('This is a closure');\n  }\n  return myOtherFunc();\n};\nmyFunc();\n```\n[Click here](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/19d990da9c7cf57945e588461b0bb1f7) to view the live code sample.\n\n```javascript\nvar myFunc = function() {\n  var myOtherFunc = function() {\n    document.write('This is a closure. ');\n  }\n  return myOtherFunc();\n};\n\nvar i = 0;\nsetInterval(function() {\n  i += 1;\n  if (i < 5) {\n    myFunc();\n  }\n}, 1000);\n```\n\nYou can view & play with the code about by going to the [link here](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/6d2d1f7e8ae56ea51f5082e1058421e3).\n",

This is very important to make sure that your code is not overwritten.\n\n## _Public_ vs _Private_\n\n- Public variables or functions can be added to, modified, or deleted.\n- Private variables or functions can't be changed.\n\n## A recent code challenge\n\nThis concept is still pretty new to me so my boss gave me the task of writting some functions that would iterate on a number so that:\n\n-  there would be 3 functions that would be aware of each other & each function would add 1.\n-  there would then be a global variable that would be declared that would call 1 of the functions\n-  then there would be another parent function that would call the 2nd original function\n-  within that parent function there would be another child function that would call the 3rd function & log the value for the 3 orginal functions\n-  within that parent function, after the child function - the child function would be called twice.\n-  after then closing of the parent function, the parent function would be called three times\n\n```javascript\n\nvar num = 1;\n\nvar aHero = function() {\n  return num++;\n};\nvar aDeed = function() {\n  return num++;\n};\n\nvar aFoil = function() {\n  return num++;\n};\n\nvar log = function(text) {\n  $('#logArea').append('<div>' + text + '</div>');\n}\n\nvar hero = aHero();\nvar newSaga = function() {\n  var foil = aFoil();\n  var saga = function() {\n    var deed = aDeed();\n    log(hero + ' ' + deed + ' ' + foil);\n  }\n  saga();\n  saga();\n};\nnewSaga();\nnewSaga();\n```\n\n**Which renders the result of:**\n\n```javascript\n1 3 2\n1 4 2\n1 6 5\n1 7 5\n```\n\nAfter a little understand of the concept for the above task, I was able to render the result fairly easily. Then my boss threw in what he called a wrinkle. He put in a check that sets `num` to be the letter `a`.\n\n```javascript\nvar theNumber = 1;\n\nvar aHero = function() {\n  return theNumber++;\n};\nvar aDeed = function() {\n  return theNumber++;\n};\n\nvar aFoil = function() {\n  return theNumber++;\n};\n\nvar log = function(text) {\n  $('#logArea').append('<div>' + text + '</div>');\n}\n\nvar hero = aHero();\nvar newSaga = function() {\n  var foil = aFoil();\n  var saga = function() {\n  \tif( typeof num !== 'undefined') {\n      num = 'a';\n    }\n    var deed = aDeed();\n    log(hero + ' ' + deed + ' ' + foil);\n  }\n  saga();\n  saga();\n};\nnewSaga();\nnewSaga();\n```\n\n**The code abe renders this result:**\n\n```javascript\nNaN NaN NaN\nNaN NaN NaN\nNaN NaN NaN\nNaN NaN NaN\nNaN NaN NaN\n```\n\nMy boss then asked me to, without changing anything inside of the parent, `NewSaga()` function, render the original result which was honestly very challenging for me.\n\nThis is what I came up with with some help.\n\n```javascript\nvar incrementProvider = function() {\n  var num = 1;\n  var addTheNumber = function() {\n    var result = num;\n    num = num + 1;\n    return result;\n  };\n  return addTheNumber;\n};\n\nvar theNumber = incrementProvider();\n\nvar aHero = function() {\n  return theNumber();\n};\nvar aDeed = function() {\n  return theNumber();\n};\n\nvar aFoil = function() {\n  return theNumber();\n};\n\nvar log = function(text) {\n  $('#logArea').append('<div>' + text + '</div>');\n}\n\nvar hero = aHero();\nvar newSaga = function() {\n  var foil = aFoil();\n  var saga = function() {\n    if( typeof num !== 'undefined') {\n      num = 'a';\n    }\n    var deed = aDeed();\n    log(hero + ' ' + deed + ' ' + foil);\n  }\n  saga();\n  saga();\n};\nnewSaga();\nnewSaga();\n```\n\nLive [code](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/14c4a193a20462b0b7c23a8b3128bc2d)\n\n**And this is what my boss came up with:**\n\n```javascript\nvar GeneratorClass = function() {\n  var inside = 1;\n  var numberGenerator = function() {\n    return (inside++).toString();\n  }\n  return {numberGenerator: numberGenerator};\n};\n\nvar generator = new GeneratorClass();\nvar aHero = generator.numberGenerator;\nvar aDeed = generator.numberGenerator;\nvar aFoil = generator.numberGenerator;\n\n//var aHero = (new GeneratorClass()).numberGenerator;\n//var aDeed = (new GeneratorClass()).numberGenerator;\n//var aFoil = (new GeneratorClass()).numberGenerator;\n\nvar log = function(text) {\n  $('#logArea').append('<div>' + text + '</div>');\n}\n\nvar hero = aHero();\nvar newSaga = function() {\n  var foil = aFoil();\n  var saga = function() {\n    if( typeof num !== 'undefined') {\n      num = 'a';\n    }\n    var deed = aDeed();\n    log(hero + ' ' + deed + ' ' + foil);\n  }\n  saga();\n  saga();\n};\nnewSaga();\nnewSaga();\n```\n\nLive [code](http://codepen.io/scottlaplante/pen/RryKEe)\n\nBoth examples render the same result but my boss's code is much cleaner I think.\n\nThis project was given to me after doing Udacity's [OOP JavaScript class](//www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015). It's been interesting after reviewing the class with my boss how much I thought I understood versus how much I actually do in practice.\n\nWelp, back to coding ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I've realized trying to explain it a few times that it's difficult to explain.\n\nThe _this_ keyword is a parameter that gets bound to an object. That parameter this is determined by how a function of method is called. It behaves almost exactly like a normal parameter.\n\nHere’s a list of what the keyword this is **not** bound to:\n\n-  the object created literal\n-  the function object it appears in\n-  a new function it appears in\n-  a object that has a function of the property\n-  the objects execution context\n\nKey’s to figuring out what the key work This will be bound to\n\n-  This gets bound to the object left of the dot (period, ‘.’)\n-  If the keyword new is used to create a new object This gets bound to that new object\n-  If there is not dot & no keyword this will get bound to the global object\n-  When using the .call() method another argument is passed in & This takes that value\n\nThe 4 ways this is initiated:\n\n-  In a function.\n\n```javascript\nfunction funcName() {};\n```\n\n-  In a method\n\n```javascript\nvar obj = {\n     funcName : function() {}\n}\n```\n\n-  As a constructor\n\n```javascript\nfunction myFunc(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n};\nvar newMyFunc = new myFunc(‘Jeff');\ndocument.write(newMyFunc.name);\n```\n\n- Using **.call();** or **.apply();** methods\n\n```javascript\nfunction juggle() {\n  var result = 0;\n  for (var n = 0; n < arguments.length; n++) {\n   result += arguments[n];\n  }\n  this.result = result;\n};\n\nvar ninja1 = {};\nvar ninja2 = {};\n\njuggle.apply(ninja1, [1, 2, 3, 4]);\njuggle.call(ninja2, 5, 6, 7, 8);\n```\n\n**example:**\n\n```javascript\nvar fn = function(one, two) {\n    log(one, two);\n};\n\nvar r = {},\n    g = {},\n    b = {};\n\nr.method = fn; // This gets bound to r\nr.method(g, b); // This gets bound to r\nfn(g, b); // This gets bound to the global object\nfn.call(r, g, b); // This gets bound to r\n```\n\nAfter looking at the _this_ key word in a bunch of ways, the best way to describe the _this_ parameter is to say that it is a powerful tool to reference the object that your working with. The only thing to make sure of if you're confused about what 'this' is put it in a `console.log()` so `console.log(this);`.\n",

The process of describing what's happening in a program I find highly beneficial. As I was talking through the program I noticed the `[argument](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)` key word.\n\nThe `argument` key word is an object that stores the arguments passed into a function within the scope of that function.\n\n```javascript\nvar passArguments = function() {\n  return document.write(arguments.length);\n};\npassArguments(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n// result: the document prints out 5\n```\n\nLive [Code](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/2f64d380b74302b396927d297828cd3a)\n\nFor the program that I was working on today, the program takes the first argument of the function `passArguments` as stores it in a variable set as category. Then it loops through the other argemuents & strong them in the logs array.\n\n```javascript\nvar passArguments = function() {\n\tvar category = arguments[0];\n\tlogs = new Array( arguments.length - 1 );\n\tfor (var i = 0, j = logs.length; i < j; i++) {\n\t  logs[i] = arguments[i+1];\n\t}\n\tdocument.write(category + ' : ' + '[' + logs + ']' );\n};\npassArguments('Categories', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5');\n```\n\nLive [Code](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/6b24e79b8dcd00668619acd396dd4b46)\n\nWhile my boss & I were going over the program, he wrote out the code similarily to how a browser compiles it.\n\n```javascript\narguments = ['ga', 'info a', 'info b', 'info c']\narguments = ['ga', 'info a', 'info b', 'info c']\n\ncategory = 'ga';\nlogs = [ , , ]\n\nfor loop\nstart at: 0\ngo to: 3\n\nfor loop 1( i = 0)\nlogs[0] = 'info a'\nlogs = [ 'info a', , ]\n\nfor loop 2 (i = 1)\nlogs = [ 'info a', 'info b', ]\n\nfor loop 3\nlogs = [ 'info a', 'info b', 'info c']\n\nend for loop\n```\n",

So, getting started with a Car Object - I'll create basic care properties & values with a method to define the properties & functions of a car.\n\n## 1. Writing a basic object\n\n```javascript\nvar car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  tires: '4',\n  doors: '4',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    return speed++;\n  }\n}\nconsole.log(car);\n```\nLive [code](http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/11d907a2ace3de3939a17e9ac3b5367f/)\n\nThere's are some issues with this code. One is, what would happen if you wanted to write a new car object with different properties? Another is, what would happen to our object if some used the same variable name?\n\n```javascript\nvar car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n\nvar van = {\n  color: 'blue',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n// man, we're writing a lot of code for 2 objects which are basically the same.\nconsole.log(car, van);\nvar car = 0;\nconsole.log(car);\n// & crap, now setting the variable car to 0 - we just overwrote the object.\n```\n\nLive [code](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/6880faa269c6a2efc627943fccdb9085).\n\nFrom the last example above, we can see that writing out all of those objects like that would be difficult. Also, we can see that we can/could just re-assign the variable which defines the object & the entire object would be re-defined.\n\n## 2. Prototype Chains\n\nAfter seeing a basic Javascript Object & seeing where it can fail & where it can become very repetitious we can begin to understand why more complex objects are more important.\n1. We should always try to keep our code [DRY](//code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-key-software-principles-you-must-understand--net-25161) (not repeating).\n2. We should try to not have our code be re-writable.\n\nPrototype Chains, deal with the first issue - keep things DRY.\n\n## Generally be aware of these things while reading this post or building objects\n\n**Object.create** is used to copy another object\n- After Object.create is used, if an object DOES NOT have a property it will go to the original object to see if that object has the property.\n- the copied properties are inherited 1 time\n\nThe **Object Prototype** has various helper functions that are inherited from Object. What this means is, built into the browser, JS has methods that are automatically attached to an object when it is created.\n\nThe **Object Constructor** is not the _Object Prototype_. An _Object constructor_ is the object that the an instance of an Object was instansiated from; basically the object constructor is GOD to the an instance of an object.\n\n**array prototype** has various helper functions & is associated with an array\n- delegates to the object prototype\n\n```javascript\nvar car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n\nvar van = Object.create(car);\n\nvan.back = 'You can sleep in the back of this thing!';\nconsole.log(van.color, van.back);\n```\n\nView it [live](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/1665f351bf708ff50d0d797a086bfe3d).\n\nIn the example above we create a static object and then copy it using **Object.create()**. That Object has access to helper functions, or methods, that are part of the Javascript Prototype. When an Object Prototype is created the instance of that creation is that Object's Object Constructor. The Object Constructor points to what instansiated that Object.\n\nThat's confusing so here's an example to demonstate.\n\n```javascript\nvar AConstructor = function(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nvar newConstructor = new AConstructor('The Constructor');\ndocument.write('newConstructor.constructor is ' + newConstructor.constructor);\n```\n\nLive [code](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/cd51d0d430c6dd567cd42670d4429565).\n\nSo, in summary of Prototype Chains - they save us some time by allowing us to copy Objects & there properties but the still do not resolve the first issue - the original Object can be overwritten if it is assigned to a new value.\n\n## 3. Object Decorator Pattern\n\nThe Object Decorator takes in an object & adds properties or methods to it. It's common to use adjectives (see below for reference, note the name _descriptive_).\n\n```javascript\nvar descriptive = function(obj, num) {\n  obj.num = num;\n  obj.descriptiveCount = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  };\n  return obj;\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** Notice in the example above that _obj_ is used where we could seemingly use the key word _this_. The reason why _obj_ was used is because of the _execution context_. If _this_ was used we would keep recreating the function descriptiveCount every time a new instance of the _descriptive_ object.\n\n## 4. Functional Classes\n\nA simple summation of a JavaScript Class is a function that can create similar Objects.\n\nThe difference between a _Decorator_ & a _Class_ is that a _Class_ _**builds**_ the Object where a _Decorator_ accepts the object.\n\n```javascript\n// Decorator\nvar descriptive = function(obj, num) {\n  obj.descriptiveCount = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  };\n  return obj;\n}\n\n// Class\nvar AClass = function(num) {\n  // Note on the line below that the class is being created within the function\n  var obj = {num: num}\n  obj.addOne = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  }\n  return obj;\n}\n```\n\n-  Classes are written with a Capital first letter\n-  They are written with Constructor Functions. Constructor Functions are functions that create a _class_.\n-  A Class contains all of the things that we would like to build (properties, methods)\n-  Objects that get returned from a class are _instances_.\n\n```javascript\nvar AClass = function(num) {\n  var obj = {num: num};\n  obj.methods = AClass.methods;\n  // Note, extends could be added here to replace the line above like:\n  // extends(obj, AClass.methods);\n  return obj;\n}\nAClass.methods = {\n  addOne : function() {\n    this.num++;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n-  The example above demonstrates how to add a method to a class without duplicating the method within the execution context every times a new instance is created.\n-  **Note**: we could use extends to extend the methods of the _AClass (from the example above)_ or a _Class_ but this is not provided natively in JavaScript.\n\n## 5. Prototypal Classes\n\nPrototypal Classes can be used instead of _extends_ or (from the last example above) _obj.methods = AClass.methods;_ to store all methods of a _class_.\n\nPrototypal Classes, or the Prototypal Pattern are best used for sharing methods in a way that doesn't inflate the execution context.\n\n```javascript\nvar AClass = function(num) {\n  var obj = Object.create(AClass.prototype);\n  obj.num = num;\n  return obj;\n}\nAClass.prototype.addOne = function() {\n  this.num++;\n}\n// Note: AClass.prototype.constructor (all prototypes hav a constructor property)\nvar aNewClass = AClass(1);\naNewClass.addOne();\n```\n\n## 6. Pseudo-classical Classes\n\nThe difference between Pseudo-classical Classes & Prototypal Classes is that the _new_ key word to instansiate a new object so we no longer need to return the Object or use _Object.create()_. See the example below for reference.\n\n```javascript\nvar AClass = function(num) {\n  // var obj = Object.create(AClass.prototype);\n  this.num = num;\n  // return obj;\n  // by using the new key word below we can comment out (remove in most situations) the 2 lines of code above\n}\nAClass.prototype.addOne = function() {\n  this.num++;\n}\nvar aNewClass = new AClass(1);\naNewClass.addOne();\n```\n\n## 7. Super-Classes & Sub-Classes\n\n_**Sub-Classes**_ & _**Super-Classes**_ give the power for objects to share classes but be different.\n\n```javascript\n  var Car = function() {\n    var obj = {loc: loc};\n    obj.move = function() {\n      obj.loc++;\n    }\n    return obj;\n  };\n  var Van = function(loc) {\n    var obj = Car(loc);\n    obj.grab = function(){\n\n    };\n    return obj;\n  }\n  var Cop = function(loc) {\n    var obj = Car(loc);\n    obj.call = function() {\n\n    };\n    return obj;\n  }\n  var amy = Van(1);\n  amy.move();\n  var cal = Cop(2);\n  cop.call();\n```\n\n## 8. Super-Class, Sub-Class & Pseudo Classical Sub-Classes\n\n```javascript\n  var Car = function(loc) {\n       this.loc = loc;\n  };\n  Car.prototype.move = function() {\n       this.loc++;\n  };\n  var Van = function(loc) {\n       Car.call(this, loc);\n  };\n  Van.prototype = Object.create(Car.prototype);\n  Van.prototype.constructor = Van.constructor;\n  Van.prototype.grab = function() {};\n\n  // Calls\n  var OtherCar = new Car(6);\n  OtherCar.move();\n\n  var VarCar2 = new Van(8);\n  console.log(VanCar2.loc);\n  VarCar2.move();\n```\n\nAs I was preparing through this post I was gathering information from various sources but was mainly following the instruction of [UdaCity's JS OOP Course](//www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015).\n",

Where some ES6 featuring can get ugly at build time, I've found that ES6 strings are very powerful. \n\nStrings with dynamic data used to be structured something like this:\n\n```javascript\n\nvar someData = 'this is some data' + someVar + 'some other data';\n\n```\n\nWith ES6, we can write strings much more cleanly:\n\n```javaScript\n\nconst someData = `this is some data ${someVar} some other data`;\n\n```\n\nTo me this is much more clear and I've found when transpiling code, the end result is as expected _most_ every time.\n\n## But wait, there's more\n\nAfter watching [ES6 for Everyone](//es6.io/) by [Wes Bos](//wesbos.com/) I learned more about template tagging.\n\n###  Template Tagging \n\nTemplate tagging makes template strings more dynyamic. \n\nThe example below iterates over a string and an undefined number of values (using the [spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) operator) within a string until the the string is a static value.\n\n```javaScript\n\nfunction addCustomName(stings, ...values) {\n  let str = ''; \n  strings.forEach((string, i) => {\n    str += string + (values[i] || '');\n  });\n}\n\nconst fullName = addCustomName`Hi, my name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`;\nconsole.log(fullName);\n\n```\n\n## ES6 Templates Notes Conclusion\n\nAfter watching ES6 for everyone, the course re-affirmed information about Template Strings and Tagging. The course's careful description and examples of template tagging offered a much clearer its utility. ~Thanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Beware if you follow Google directions for bicycles you WILL end up on a hiking trail not suited for road bikes unless you & your bike are way more bad ass than me.\n\n![A few miles into the GMR boast beautiful canyon view with LA in the distance.](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5804/23722600469_f8a9a34ba0_b.jpg)\n\nWater & Food: That’s a pretty cool part about this ride because, well, you don’t have to worry much. There’s water & food in Azusa & there’s water & food in Mount Baldy Village so if you plan on 20 miles in between both points - you should be good.\n\nKey sites: During most of the ride you’ll have great views. Particularly, you’ll be able to see the [San Gabriel Reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Dam) which, I’ve semi-joked with friends about being the last visible water in LA. You’ll also be able to see Mount Baldy & other high hills & mounts which do a great job of making a rider feel small & in adequate in the world.\n\n> You’ll also be able to see Mount Baldy & other high hills & mounts which do a great job of making a rider feel small & in adequate to the world.\n\nThe trip personally for me was bitter sweet. One of my best riding buds, [Brett Pitts](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1283635?oq=bre), is about to move so we decided we had to make the ride happen. We zipped up the inline from Azusa & raced on the ridge after switching to [Glendora Ridge Rd](http://www.toughascent.com/blog/tag/glendora-ridge-road/). We made the ride in the middle of November so we were comfortable riding with our kits & a vest. I wore my [Rapha Lightweight Kit & Vest](http://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/gift-bundles/category/bundles) & it suited me perfectly for the ride.\n\n<iframe frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' style=\"min-height: 405px;\" scrolling='no' src='//www.strava.com/activities/432826817/embed/96dd9da58f55dc1ec44bc7fd57e72442ad7d36e7'></iframe>\n",

I, Jeff Wainwright, discuss myself and the\n  first time I saw a William Kentridge exhibit\nshow_image: true\nnote: no-featured-image\nfeatured_image: https://yowainwright.imgix.net/things-change/man.jpg\ncategories:\n- art\n- story\n---\n\nRemembering the first time I saw [William Kentridge](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kentridge): it was in Chicago and I drove down from Madison, Madison Wisconsin with my girlfriend. I was around 21. I'm 35 now. I threw a temper tantrum while trying to find a place to park in the magnificent mile area.\n{: .first-paragraph}\n\nAfter parking, I remember looking into girlfriend's big green eyes right after we got out of the car. She was looking at me so empathically. \"I'm going to dump you in a few months\" she was probably thinking. She was just waiting for right exit. It's not that I didn't have good qualities then. I was full of charisma and passion but my passion was usually about art or skateboarding and _I could be selfish_ in general. However, this moment at the MCA, seeing Kentridge's work for the first time, was a moment in which my passion for art allowed me to be open to a beautiful world outside of me.\n\n> \"I'm going to dump you in a few months\" she was probably thinking still waiting for right exit.\n\nThe Kentridge Exhibit was at the [MCA](//mcachicago.org/Home) during the winter. I remember the weather being cold and feeling grumpy, even after my car was parked. I drove a long way get here (I thought to myself). I am so busy and have semester finals and I don't have time for this (I thought to myself). I think that even then my hair was thinning. I can remember, or at least imagine, tufts of blond hair on top of my intense furrowed face blowing in the wind as my girlfriend and I walked up the steps to the museum—my hair and her planning their escape. My hair: \"I'm going to slowly and politely leave out the back\". My girlfriend: \"Ah, the fade away. Me too!\".\n\nWe all (my hair, my girlfriend and I) entered the museum and got to the exhibit. The exhibit was a series of installation videos. Each video was a narrative done in charcoal frames.\n\nKentridge's process for making his videos was/is:\n- do the drawing with charcoal on paper,\n- manipulate the unset charcoal on that _same piece of paper_ for multiple stills of the video.\n\nThe result of his drawing process was that rest of the gallery space, besides the videos, were the beautiful drawings that he used for each video still. It was impressive. I loved Kentride's confidence to make drawings and then change them. It takes a rare artist to be unafraid of changing work to further communicate a narrative. This is why I found this exhibit so exciting.\n\n<iframe style=\"height: auto; min-height: 315px; width: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmvK7A84dlk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAs I was watching Kentridge's short films which dealt with time and social issues in South Africa during that time I felt my intense heart getting soft. Kentridge's sketches did more than demonstrate a deep understanding of space technically in his drawing style but also had feeling. It seemed to me that Kentridge wanted to _have a point_ more than _a beautiful sketch_. My girlfriend looked at me, I had tears welling in my eyes. This is what I remember her liking about me—my ability to be there in the moment. I could just love something. I grabbed her hand and we walked around the museum together smiling with tears in my eyes (a common scenario for me still). I felt myself being curious about the world which Kentridge had created. The empathetic narrative in his artwork extended to me wondering about my girlfriend’s reality and her feelings. I'd been selfish earlier that day, throwing tantrums and being grumpy. We'd drove down from Madison together and she was taking the same semester finals as me at the same college. I had made the drive and the trip all about me.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/things-change/william-kentridge.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing by William Kentridge: Anything Is Possible\" />\n</figure>\n\nAfter getting dinner, we went back to Madison. It was business as usual, studying for finals and going to class. We didn't talk much about those moments at the MCA. In general at that time I had an amazing gift of being a light hearted center of a party type of guy until **I wasn't**. So we coasted until the semester was done. Those moments probably probably were in the front of both of our minds and but the furthest thing from words.\n\nMy parents where diplomats and stationed in Albania at that time. When finals and the semester was over, I went and visited them in Tirana. I liked Albania. It has amazing fruit. The people were friendly to me and didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that I was _a character_.\n\nOne day, while in Albania, I went with a group of hikers down by the sea. There were fisherman fishing with dynamite at the beach we were hiking on. I got a call from my girlfriend on my Nokia Cell Phone (remember: 2000/2001). \"Do you have time to talk?\", she asked. \"Of course.\", I said; dynamite explosions happening in the background. \"I've met someone; someone else\", she said, \"I don't want to be with you anymore.\". At that moment, a dynamite explosion happened. Fish and fish guts flew into the air. I could hear the fisherman boys' glee as they giggled near by. \"I understand.\", I said to my girlfriend on the phone.\n\n>\"I don't want to be with you anymore.\". At that moment, a dynamite explosion happened. Fish and fish guts flew into the air.\n\nWe, Emily (my girlfriend of that time) and I, talked a few times after that and not about us really. The conversations were more along the lines of: \"Can I get this back?\". There was never much closure and there didn't have to be. We were very different and I'd been a selfish boyfriend for the most part. I think fondly of moments I spent with her and I smile when I think of my first time seeing William Kentridge and getting dumped to the sound of fish being blown up with dynamite in the background (not about the fish being blown up specifically - I'm not into that).\n\nYears later, I did a series of work - fully embracing that eye opening situation and the new door to life that was accessed after seeing William Kentridge’s work.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/things-change/man.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing by William Kentridge: Anything Is Possible\" />\n</figure>\n",

Effective Altruism _is a philosophy and social movement that applies evidence and reason to determining the most effective ways to improve the world_ ~[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism).\n\nBig Question: So you want to make a contribution?\n\n## Impact Spectrum\n\n-  Scaled Direct Service\n-  Systems Change\n-  Framework Change\n-  Direct Service\n   -  Localized Impact\n   -  Does it leverage skills?\n\n## Philosophy\n\n-  [Effective Altruism](http://www.effectivealtruism.org/)\n   -  Charity Navigator\n   -  Give Well (Better)\n\n## How to look into helping\n\n-  [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/): Making the biggest difference with your career\n-  [Catchafire](https://www.catchafire.org/): skills based volunteering\n\n## Summary of Presentation: Discussing tech for non-profits & how you can get involved\n\n-  New Project Andrew is working on: [Good Technology Project](http://goodtechnologyproject.org/) (Information Technology)\n-  He's working with TED Fellows so far\n-  An example - Data Oasis - create a ways to connect data\n\n## Q/A\n\n-  Rewarding: putting people together\n-  Non-profits: [xprize](http://www.xprize.org/)\n-  Board Level: confused with data opportunities\n-  Book: Doing Good Better\n\n\n## Meetup Topic 2: Making the Washio Echo App with speaker Patrick Teague\n\nPatrick Teague with [Washio](https://www.getwashio.com/) made an app so that their (Washio's) customer's could use Alexa to get their clothes to be cleaned. He discussed how he made to Echo App, some utilities he used & some bugs he encountered.\n\n<figure class=\"figure figure--full\">\n\t<iframe style=\"height: auto; min-height: 315px; width: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/acybh2Q_qNg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n## Alexa (an Amazon device), responds to your voice commands\n\n-  Alexa apps are called skill\n   -  consists of 1 or more intents\n      -  `[Alexa],[App][What to do]`\n      -  `Alexa:{App: {what to do: ‘’}}`\n-  Alexa skills kits are called asks\n-  Amazon manages some key words like `yes` & with synonyms\n-  Your app has to tell you how to use it.\n\nNote: *NPM Module = AlexaApp*\n\n## Q/A\n\n-  Do you have to have an Echo? Yes\n-  Does Alexa have push functionality? No\n-  Does Alexa do well recognizing your voice? Yes\n-  Does Alexa support multiple languages? Yes\n-  You have to have certified Alexa namespace.\n\n**NOTE (5/24/2016)**: Links to powerpoints _might_ happen. ~Thanks\n",

His name is Jaret Fowler & he can be found [here](//github.com/10000highfives). He started the project [Webflight](//webflight.io).

He described why nodejs made building robotics easier (My lack of notes for his presentation has nothing to do with the quality of the presentation). \n\nThe third presentor, [Yunong Xiao](//yunong.io/), discsussed *node in production*; especially debugging it. He briefly summarized how the product is set up & then dug into how he & his team went into debugging issues using their node product.\n\n## Cliff notes of Node in production\n\n**Summary**\n-  Website runs on node\n-  Built with react\n-  Dynamic asset manager\n\n## Debugging\n\n_lets work the problem & not guessing (Apollo 13)_\n\n-  Runtime performance\n   -  Restify\n-  Runtime crashes\n   -  stack trace\n   -  flame graph\n-  Memory leaks\n   -  core dump\n      -  postmortem\n      -  debug\n   -  restart app\n",

I felt the humid Texas air against my skin. I listened to the sounds of wildlife turn up as the sun went down. The light as it creeped below the horizon of the lake peeked rays through the soft tree landscape. It reminded me of my childhood.\n\nI was surprised by how many families were there, at the lake & how alive the park seemed. When I was done with my ride, my friend pointed out a firefly & said, \"it's been so long since I've seen 1 of those\". \"Me too\", I said.\n\nI felt community in that moment at White Rock that I hadn't felt in years.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/white-rock-lake/brett-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Brett Riding\" />\n</figure>\n\nWhen I was young, traveling between my parent's homes, I would visit family around lakes in Wisconsin. My older cousins would ride boats & water ski. As 1 of the younger cousins, I would swim within the shallow parts around docks. We (other younger cousins as I) would sometimes get in canoes & look for crawfish, turtles & frogs. At night, we would try to catch fireflies.\n\nLife seemed very simple. It seemed like a small place by the water was every family's goal. If 1 family didn't have much - they'd just stay with another family by a lake on the weekend. It felt like community - american community. I don't know if that community exists as much anymore. I know it doesn't for me. I felt very proud & content.\n\n>It felt like community - American community.

Recently, I was challenged to make some sticky items that were fairly complex so I decided to write a plugin that would work for me & my use cases called [Sticky Bits](https://github.com/yowainwright/sticky-bits).\n{: .first-paragraph}\n\n> `*position: fixed` is a css rule for sticky navigation which positions `html elements` at a fixed point on the page.\n\nSticky Navigation in my purview became more relavant with an implemenation of [scrollspy](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/scrollspy/) by bootstrap years ago. It seemed that providing users with visual queues became expected by users or by companies to provide location & extra navigation to users on webpages. `Triggers` that set a navigation's position to stick & change vary throughout many web experiences so I'm only going to focus on a few things that I've seen.\n\n### Browser sticky navigation\n{: #device-fixed-position }\n\n*Sticky navigation:* This is when a navigation is sticky to the top of a webpage from the start. This is typically done when setting an element to `position: fixed` & then either setting adding a `margin-top` to the next sibling element that is equal to the height of the fixed navigation or adding an `element` that wraps the sticky nav & then has a height that is set to the height of the fixed navigation.\n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/blades\">\n\t<img src=\"/assets/device-scrolling/dsc-fixed-nav.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky navigation\" />\n\t</a>\n</figure>\n\n*Static then fixed navigation:* This is when a navigation appears to be static & then a when a customer scrolls to where the top of the browser window meets the top of the sticky element - the element appears to snap to the top of the browser window. This is done by typically  wrapping the sticky navigation in an element that is set to the height of the navigation. Using a Javascript `.onscroll` event - the browser scroll event tracks for when `window.scrollY` is greater that the sticky navigation element's `.offsetTop`. This is typically a very expensive javascript call as it is done continually throughout the process of a customer's scroll. This is why functions like [throttling](https://remysharp.com/2010/07/21/throttling-function-calls), [debouncing](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function) & [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) are often used to help. This is still an issue as delays in the sticky navigation can easily occur.\n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"https://medium.com/\">\n\t<img src=\"/assets/device-scrolling/Medium.jpg\" alt=\"Static then fixed navigation\" />\n\t</a>\n</figure>\n\n*Fixed navigation with a scroll stop:* This is when a navigation is sticky & then at a certain point the sticky nav stops. This is often done by setting a navigation to fixed & then when element reaches a scroll `stopping point`, the navigation is set with a `position` of `absolute` with a `top` position that equals the _height of the stopping offset_.\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/\">\n\t<img src=\"/assets/device-scrolling/billboard.jpg\" alt=\"Fixed navigation with a scroll stop\" />\n\t</a>\n</figure>\n\n*Scrolled distance queue navigation:* This is when a navigation is set to fixed & has some sort of visual queue that lets a user know how far they've scrolled. This is often done by returning a scrolled distance relative to a total window scroll. This is done by first storing scroll in a variable & thend returning it out of a function.\n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/beverly-hills-1-billion-vineyard-819299\">\n\t<img src=\"/assets/device-scrolling/thr.jpg\" alt=\"Scrolled distance queue navigation\" />\n\t</a>\n</figure> \n\n{% highlight javascript %}\n\tvar scrollPosition = 0;\n\n\tvar scrollDistance = function() {\n\t\tvar newScrollPosition = window.scrollY;\n\t\tif ( ( newScrollPosition > scrollPosition ) && newScrollPosition > somethingToMeasure ) {\n\t\t    \t// Something to do\n\t\t} else if ( newScrollPosition < scrollPosition ) {\n\t\t      // Something else to do\n\t\t} \n\t\treturn scrollPosition = newScrollPosition;\n\t};\n\treturn window.addOnScroll(scrollDistance);\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n## Device Fixed Position & Sticky Bits\n{: #device-fixed-position }\n\nDevice sticky items are [very undependable](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/fixed-position/) as many devices don't support `fixed positioning` or only partially support it which often creates a weird lag when a customer is scrolls a page. \n\n> Device sticky items are very undependable as many devices don't support `fixed positioning`\n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"http://leafo.net/sticky-kit/\">\n\t<img src=\"/assets/device-scrolling/leafo.jpg\" alt=\"Device sticky items\" />\n\t</a>\n</figure> \n\nIt seems that fixed position was more supported by IOS a few years ago but support has lagged as Apple has defined fixed positioning as [different because of an unchangeable size for a browser window](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2010/tn2262/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40009577-CH1-SAFARI_ON_IPAD_READINESS_CHECKLIST-4__MODIFY_CODE_THAT_RELIES_ON_CSS_FIXED_POSITIONING). [More...](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/AdjustingtheTextSize/AdjustingtheTextSize.html)\n\nIt was after trying very hard to come up with a solition for fixed position support that I decided to see if making `absolute positioning` work like fixed position could be a solution. It was then that I came on to this [post](https://coderwall.com/p/8rz_7g/how-to-emulate-position-fixed-using-absolute-positioning) which uses css to essentially hijack window scrolling from the window so that elements positioned absolutely can behave in a way similarly to what we'd expect with fixed position. \n\n{% highlight css %}\n\thtml {\n\t  position: absolute;\n\t  height: 100%;\n\t  overflow: hidden;\n\t}\n\n\tbody {\n\t  height: 100%;\n\t  overflow: auto;\n\t}\n\n\t.fixed {\n\t  position: absolute;\n\t}\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nI've been writing a plugin to accept standard web fixed position patterns as well as device fixed position patterns called [Sticky Bits](https://github.com/yowainwright/sticky-bits). \n\nHere's a demo of the absolute position solution:\n\n<p data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"Bzxmpw\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"yowainwright\" data-embed-version=\"2\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/Bzxmpw/\">Bzxmpw</a> by Jeff Wainwright (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright\">@yowainwright</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If you're not aware, _container_ is technical term when talking about html & css that is used to describe an html element that \"contains\" other html elements. I try to avoid the pattern (of containing elements) by placing a `max width` on individual elements within a content area. In this post I'll describe in detail what I used to do, the solution I used more recently & what I'm doing now. \n{: .first-paragraph}\n\nFirst, to go into more detail if I've already confused you _(sorry)_, I'll more clearly describe what I see as the problem. When creating content blocks for webpages, widths are set so that the reader line length doesn't get to long. For smaller browser views, like on mobile devices, space to the left & right of content areas are set so that text doesn't extend the full width of the browser width or, worse yet - extend out of the browser so that the text can't be read. \n\n> When creating content blocks for webpages, widths are set so that the reader line length doesn't get to long. For smaller browser views, like on mobile devices, space to the left & right of content areas are set so that text doesn't extend the full width of the browser\n\n## The 3 approaches\n\n- Using containers to set the width of content.\n\n- Setting margins on elements within a content area.\n\n- Setting the margins once & setting elements widths as desired \n\n\n## The old way, using containers to set the width of content\n\n{% highlight sass %}\n\t// Old way\n\t// don't worry about the margins on content elements \n\tp {\n\t\t// Note \n\t\t// there is no width set\n\t\tmargin: 0;\n\t}\n\t// set margins to the left & right of the wrapper element\n\t.container {\n\t\t// margins are set in this example on the left, right, top & bottom\n\t\t// max width is set here too\n\t\tmargin: 1rem;\n\t\tmax-width: 50rem;\n\t}\n\t@media (min-width: 50rem) {\n\t\t// center the wrapper if the width is greater than 50rem\n\t\t.container {\n\t\t\tmargin-left: auto;\n\t\t\tmargin-right: auto;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nIn this method of setting margins & widths on content, a container element is used to set the `width` of the content & the margins that are set on the left & right of the content. The positives of this approach are that content width & margins can be set on one wrapper element. The negatives with this approach are - what if you have an image, or another element that you'd like to have a different width - you might set a negative margin & exaggerate the width like, `margin: 0 -1rem 0 1rem, width: calc(100% + 2rem);`. This is already bad & then what if the containing element has a `oveflow: hidden` property set. Ugh, you're going to get into crazy town & fast. \n\n## The _last current_ way, setting different margins on different content elements\n\n{% highlight sass %}\n\t// The last current way\n\tp {\n\t\tmargin: 1rem 1rem 0;\n\t}\n\timg {\n\t\tmargin: 1rem 0;\n\t}\n\t@media (min-width: 750px) {\n\t\tp,\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tmargin-left: auto;\n\t\t\tmargin-right: auto;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t// set margins to the left & right of the wrapper element\n\t.container {\n\t\t// no margins in this example on the left, right, top & bottom\n\t\t// no max width set on this example\n\t}\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nIn this method, a container element plays no role in setting the width of content within a viewport. Elements within a content block are contained by margins & max widths. Max widths may or may not be set on elements but this method often requires the use 2 margin rules on different viewports & setting a width or max width on larger viewports. The margins will almost always go something like be `1rem` to the _left_ & _right_ on small viewports but be set to `auto` on large viewports. With this approach there is almost always that in between moment where to content gets really wide or is positioning on the left of browser because the left & right margins haven't been set to `auto` yet. \n\n## The _current_ current way, setting the margins once & setting elements widths as desired \n\n{% highlight sass %}\n\t// The new new way\n\tp,\n\timg {\n\t\tmargin: 1rem auto 0;\n\t\tmax-width: calc(100% - 2rem);\n\t}\n\timg {\n\t\tmargin: 1rem  auto 0;\n\t\tmax-width: 100% !important;\n\t}\n\t@media (min-width: 750px) {\n\t\tp {\n\t\t\tmax-width: 50rem;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t// set margins to the left & right of the wrapper element\n\t.container {\n\t\t// no margins in this example on the left, right, top & bottom\n\t\t// no max width set on this example\n\t}\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nFinally, my perferred approach is to set the margins of properties only once & resetting the preferred width of elements based on the viewport size. I do this with calc. It works great. So for a mobile view I have the width set to `calc(100% - 2rem)` which tells the browser make this element 100% of the viewport width with a margin of 1 on either side. You'll find in this approach that the content is always centered & that elements with of 100% can be centered as well.\n\nI hope you've found this post to be informative. Please comment below if you disagree, feel I could've been more clear or have other opinions. \n\n~Thanks\n\n\n",

It makes sense! Complex tasks where benefits of thoughtful HTML are just not considered. Not only that, project goals are iterative—they are grown upon and updated in steps. Questions like, _is the HTML valid?_ or _is the HTML semantic?_ are _never_ asked. This small issue then grows on _a_ webpage as new features are added and other websites follow a similar pattern. The world and developers think it's fine because browsers have improved and the webpage looks fine—but is it? \n\n> Questions like, _is the HTML valid?_ or _is the HTML semantic?_ are never asked.\n\n## What is Semantic HTML beside something we _used_ to care about? \n\nDevelopers, product managers, maybe the whole world at this point assumes _it is easy to write [Semantic html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)_. We should not! Semantic HTML makes webpage content more legible to browsers, search engines, other developers, and is _much_ easier to maintain. Yet, when looking at source code on _many_ webpages, it is easy to find html that could be semantically improved. \n\n## Of course my HTML is valid\n\nBeyond Semantic HTML, valid HTML is an issue! With browser advancements, checking whether html webpages validate just doesn't happen. \n\n-  [Google Search](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) doesn't render valid html according to W3C spec.\n-  Neither does [Facebook](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F)\n\nValidation may not be an issue for Google and Facebook because there usership maybe be so large. However, most websites are _not_ Google or Facebook. This is where the point of valid html is _still_ be a very important thing to consider! 💭\n\n## Why might this rant matter? &hellip;Or are am I just screaming in the wind (again)?\n\nCompanies looking to grow their audience through webpages should always look to provide rich experiences that can be shared across the most possible platforms in the easiest way. Valid and semantic html would definitely make that easier and with less long run effort. \n\n## Writing HTML back in the day vs. now\n\nYears ago when writing html for webpages, everything that was done had to pass the [w3c test](https://validator.w3.org/). HTML validation tests were even looked at as a tool to find unclosed element tags and fix layout issues. Sure, there where a lot of `divs` but we could make a webpage render in Internet Explorer 6 _as expected_!\n\n> Sure, there where a lot of `divs` but we could make a webpage render in Internet Explorer 6 _as expected_!\n\nAs browsers became better, HTML5 elements became more supported, and jQuery allowing easy Dom manipulation HTML testing and review seemed to become more and more of an after thought. Then, the iPhone came and Apps took a front seat. Everyone wanted an App and webpages to look like Apps so whether a webpage's HTML was valid or not didn't matter.\n\nNow, years later, we know people don't go to many [webpages](https://www.quora.com/How-many-webpages-does-an-average-user-visit-per-day) and they don't use many [apps](http://fortune.com/2015/09/24/apps-smartphone-facebook/) so webpages have to be consumable for websites people _do_ go, usable for when people do get them, and fast for when they _are_ viewed.\n\n## Better Opportunities in HTML?\n\n**High quality html is:**\n\n-  **Consumable:** when webpages are consumed by third party services like Medium and Facebook instant articles, high quality HTML is _probably_ much more consumable.\n-  **Usable:** thoughtful HTML is much more usable for people with special needs and people in general.\n-  **Fast:** browsers can probably render thoughtful HTML better. \n\n## Tools that might help us\n\n**Here are a few tools that can be used to write better html:**\n\n-  [html validator](https://validator.w3.org/)\n-  [htmllint](https://github.com/htmllint/htmllint)\n-  [linter-htmlhint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-htmlhint)\n\n## My fingers are tired so here's the wrap-up\n\nWith tools like [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/), it may not ever be necessary but even then the matter of creating common ways of writing html is important—even more so with HTML5 and it's new elements and attributes that come along with it.\n",

Authors create content in one place & expect it to render well in another. Embedded content adds another level of complexity to this process.\n{: .first-paragraph}\n\nEmbedded content, like videos, images, podcasts & tweets often do not translate well to a fluid webpage - so we need to reframe them. This is what [Reframe.js](https://dollarshaveclub.github.io/reframe.js/) does. It wraps embedded content in an [intrinsic ratio](http://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video) of the original embed but with fluid sizing so that the embedded content looks great at any size.\n\n<p data-height=\"380\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"qaaGYV\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"yowainwright\" data-embed-version=\"2\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/qaaGYV/\">Intrinsic Ratio Animation</a> by Jeff Wainwright (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright\">@yowainwright</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n## Why Reframe.js?\n\nPrevious to writing this plugin, I used [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com/). FitVids is a great plugin for solving reframing videos. It's written by 2 of my idols, [Chris Coyier](http://chriscoyier.net/) & [Dave Ruppert](http://daverupert.com/). Fitvids _takes a chance_ that most of your content will be 1 of 5 `selectors`. If those assumptions are correct (& if you're using jQuery) - FitVids is golden. If not, there might need to be little extra code on top of the little extra code added that assumes your embedded content will be 1 of 5 `selectors`. The reason that Reframe.js was originally made was because [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) was not being used on a new product at [DSC](http://dollarshaveclub.com).\n\nReframe.js also:\n1. doesn't assume your reframing just videos (by name at least),\n2. offers a css mixin rather than inlining css which can make your dom (html) cleaner\n3. & offers jQuery plugin that is written in such a way that if unused - it can be shaken out with [Tree shaking](https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/tree-shaking-versus-dead-code-elimination-d3765df85c80#.ccnp22e5f).\nThese things make the code lighter initially.\n\n## Options\n\nThe one option supported by Reframe.js is the ability to add your own css class instead of the default css class `js-reframe`. This is so that the end result of using the library on a webpage is minimal - just 1 inline style added (for the intersic ratio).\n\nReframe.js's simplicity in both language & options is meant to make the plugin easy to understand & easy to write code to support your product's end goal.\n\n## Plugin Breakdown\n\n**CSS (aspect ratio)**\n\nIn this sass mixin, the default aspect ratio is 16:9 but we can override that to make the reframe a perfect ratio of the embed's original size.\n\n{% highlight sass %}\n\n@mixin reframe($el: iframe, $paddingTop: 56.25%){\n  padding-top: $paddingTop;\n  position: relative;\n  width: 100%;\n  #{$el} {\n    height: 100%;\n    left: 0;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n**JavaScript**\n\nWrap a selected element in a `div`.\n\n{% highlight javascript %}\n\nconst frame = element // frame is the elmeent to be wrapped\nconst div = document.createElement('div');\nframe.parentNode.insertBefore(div, frame);\nframe.parentNode.removeChild(frame);\ndiv.appendChild(frame);\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nAdd padding to create an intrinsic ratio.\n\n{% highlight javascript %}\n\n// where the frame is the element & the div is the added wrapper element\nconst height = frame.offsetHeight;\nconst width = frame.offsetWidth;\nconst padding = height / width * 100;\ndiv.style.paddingTop = padding + '%';\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nMake a plugin for jQuery or [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/).\n\n{% highlight javascript %}\n\nif (window.$) {\n  window.$.fn.extend({\n    reframe: function reframeFunc(cName) {\n      return reframe(this, cName);\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nAdd a check to the top of the plugin which allows us to select the element to reframe with jquery _or_ plain js (Kodos to [Jacob Kelley](http://jakiestfu.com/) here).\n\n{% highlight javascript %}\n\nlet frames = typeof target === 'string' ? document.querySelectorAll(target) : target;\nif (!('length' in frames)) {\n  frames = [frames];\n}\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nHere's the code you write.\n\n{% highlight javascript %}\n\nreframe('selector');\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n<p data-height=\"380\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"Gjjbak\" data-default-tab=\"css,result\" data-user=\"yowainwright\" data-embed-version=\"2\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/Gjjbak/\">Reframe.js jQuery Demo</a> by Jeff Wainwright (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright\">@yowainwright</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n## To Dos\n\nCurrently, I'm playing with the idea of removing the default padding of the ratio (56.25%) that's in the `css` because it is overwritten everytime the plugin is called.\nAlso, I think I will be adding a docs folder for using the plugin & specific use cases that might come up.\n\n## Summary\n\nOne of the fun challenges when writing code for content is to support creativity in a controlled way. Reframe.js is a great solve for making embedded content look great on your website. Initially, we didn't know if we would be using jQuery for our product at [DSC](https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/) so [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com/) was out of the question - which led me down the path of writing some new code. The end result was Reframe.js. Hope it works well for you if you use it.\n\nI plan on writing more lightweight plugins to solve common content problems in the future. If you have questions or ideas in regards to [Reframe.js](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/reframe.js) please contact me - links below.\n",

Arrow functions are simplier way to write functions in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). This post contains a few things that I wasn't completely clear on about Arrow Functions that EFE really clarified for me.\n\n## Arrow Function Illuminations:\n\n1. `This` will be undefined.\n2. Your can remove even more code cruft that is usually done with Arrow Functions (no mustache brackets needed).\n3. Arguments which are objects will not work in arrow functions\n\n## Deeper Dive\n\nWhen writing a function normal `this` can be bound to things (like elements in example). With arrow functions, _this_ (pun intended) is not the case.\n\n### The This Key Word Is Undefined\n\n**ES5 Function**\n\n```javascript\n\nvar clickFunction = function clickFunc() {\n  console.log(this);\n  // This would be the selected element\n};\nvar button1 = document.getElementById('button-1');\nbutton1.addEventListener('click', clickFunction, false);\n\n```\n\n**ES6 Arrow Function**\n\n```javascript\n\ndocument.getElementById('elem').addEventListener('click', () => {\n  console.log(this);\n  // `this` would be undefined\n});\n\n```\n\n### Remove Even More Cruft With Arrow Functions\n\nArrow functions can be even more minimal but most people add certain things like `mustaches` for legibility.\n\n**Standard Way of Writing an Arrow Function**\n\n```javascript\n\nconst button2 = document.getElementById('button-2');\nbutton2.addEventListener('click', () => {\n  console.log('Normal arrow function');\n});\n\n```\n\n**More Minimal Way An Arrow Function Can Be Written**\n\n```javascript\n\nconst button3 = document.getElementById('button-3');\nbutton3.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('arrow function with less cruft'));\n\n```\n\n### Objects Cannot Be Used In Arrow Function Arguments\n\nArrow functions can use arguments——as long as they're not objects.\n\n**Standard Way of Writing an Arrow Function**\n\n```javascript\n\nconst button4 = document.getElementById('button-4');\nconst anObj = {\n  name: 'Objecto'\n};\nbutton4.addEventListener('click', (anObj) => {\n  console.log(anObj);\n  // anObj will be undefined\n});\n\n```\n\n## Arrow Function Notes Conclusion\n\nPlay with the examples above on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/5e5d740b1388b400fc1cc0717f5a29f8).\n\nWhat the `this` key word will be bound to and how minimal arrow functions can be is well documented. ES6 For Everyone gives clear examples of that make it much clearer though.\n\nThank you [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/)!!!\n\n**Update:** After talking with Dan Benson a bit, I discovered even more about arrow functions. These things were covered in Wes Bos's course but I'm even clearer now. [See more](https://jeffry.in/arrow-functions-cont/) examples here. \n",

Fitness wise, I was able to surf, ride my bike and get into the climbing gym a few times. As far as computer programming, I was very close to releasing a few open source products and started taking to the time to get up to date with basic knowledge of current popular MVCs. \n\n## Surfing has been great sans a little rain 🌊 \n\n<figure class=\"width--content\">\n  <img src=\"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-1/countyline-surfing.jpg?fit=crop&w=700&h=700&auto=format\" alt=\"Countyline surf, January 7, 2017\" />\n</figure>\n\nWith a lot of rain in LA week, surfing was a safety hazard. This was because of runoff from land and all of the water being stirred up. What all of the rain has taken away from everyday surfing has been added to awesome waves on the few days I was able to get out. I went to [Countyline](http://www.surfline.com/surf-report/county-line-southern-california_4203/) with [Justin Berg](http://justinintime.com/). The sets were consistant and the wave shapes were very nice. It was my first time in the water for 2017 so I was pleasantly was surprised I was able to turn on a few waves. \n\n<figure>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/199360358\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; max-height: 360px; height: 50vw; max-width: 100%;\"></iframe>\n<<figcaption>[Sunset surf spot](https://vimeo.com/199360358) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com)Vimeo.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOn Sunday, I went to [Sunset Surf Spot](http://www.surfline.com/surf-report/sunset-beach-southern-california_119813/) and enjoyed some perfect waves. I got some long rides and even a few good turns. I was out on my [Aipa](http://www.benaipa.com/) Surfboard which doesn't seem to float as well anymore—I still had so much fun.\n\n## Slow and steady makes the smile show 😊\n\nCycling was feeling pretty good and after adding [boulder climbing](https://touchstoneclimbing.com/cliffs-of-id/) to my workout routine—my hips are feeling alright. I logged a little under [150 miles](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201701&interval_type=week&chart_type=miles&year_offset=0). My pace was slow and I still felt hesitant with hills. I was lucky to have [Devin](https://twitter.com/D_fman) join me on a few rides. \n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"http://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-1/malaga-cove-cycling.jpg?fit=crop&w=2000&h=1500&auto=format\" alt=\"Cycling in Malaga Cove, January 8, 2017\" />\n</figure>\n\n## Open Source, small things that grow 🌱\n\nMaintaining my first larger open source projects in [Shave](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/shave) and [Reframe.js](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/reframe.js) has continued to be interesting. I've learn from the questions I've received and the updates I've asked to make. Meanwhile, I've been working on [ScrollDir](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/scrolldir/stargazers) with [Patrick Fisher](https://github.com/pwfisher) and another Project called StickyBits. \n\n## JavaScript Framework Learnings 🦄\n\nI've had the opportunity to dig deeper into some JavaScript Frameworks. The frameworks that I've been learning more about are [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/). I've been comparing these frameworks to writing something that could be considered more basic using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](http://expressjs.com/). Knowing that these learnings will be done on a content site that still has relatively low traffic, speed on initial visit is very key. Hopefully, I can document more on my learnings soon! 🐥\n",

The rain in Southern California has lingered which great for water levels and local waterfalls up above Pasadena—I've enjoyed it thoroughly. This environmental change has switched my sport focus a bit—climbing more and surfing less. Beyond that, JavaScript MVC discovery has led to new open source projects to make and a few projects to contribute to as well. \n\n## Mueller Tunnel Continues to Enchant\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-2/mueller-tunnel-hike-bw-1.jpg?fit=crop&w=2000&h=2000&auto=format\" alt=\"Mueller Tunnel Hike, January 15, 2017\" />\n</figure>\n\nMueller Tunnel is located about a mile from the summit of [Mount Wilson](https://www.mtwilson.edu/). It's easy to park and view [Los Angeles lights](https://www.instagram.com/p/5ey73zSf9Z/) at sunset. Then after an easy quarter mile hike you get to the tunnel which can [capture silloutes wonderfully](https://www.instagram.com/p/BL7mWWwDd_n/). If the hike is continued past the tunnel you can reach the summit of Mount Disappointment which offers another view of Los Angeles from mountain tops and has an interesting story behind it's [name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Disappointment_(California)). I walked there this past Sunday, the 15th. Clouds appeared to be surfing the mountain ridge line and all of the rain has created unusual and beautiful waterfalls which are traversing the mountain valleys.\n\n## 🚴 Riding In the Rain—on; board or bike\n\nCycling has continued to be a challenge with the rain however views from the saddle are irresistable. I was able to maintain a bit over [130](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201702&interval_type=week&chart_type=miles&year_offset=0) but my hips were a concern going into my third week. I was able to remedy this with a bit of surfing and climbing in the gym. Yeah, gym climbing has been great for me. It challenges me to stretch and relax. \n\n<figure class=\"width--content\">\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-2/sacred-cove.jpg?fit=crop&w=2000&h=1500&auto=format\" alt=\"Cycling to Sacred Cove, January 14, 2017\" />\n</figure>\n\n## 🦄 Nuxt, Next and Svelte\n\nOver the past week, I reseached [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Next](https://zeit.co/blog/next) and [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/). I'm currently working on basic setups for Nuxt and Next with a [mentor of mine](https://github.com/briangonzalez/). If it makes sense, those projects will be open sourced. I'm also planning on using Svelte personally on this here, blog site. I'm a huge fan of [Rich Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris). [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) is my _go-to_for open source projects. It keeps my code honest. \n\n## 🐘 Tried and True\n\nI didn't have a chance to wrap up an open source project that I hoped to release this week—hopefully next week. I'm also hoping to write a [jQuery builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-builder) because the current project seems a bit stale and could maybe be optimized in a few ways. My goal is to make a modern way to build a custom version of jQuery that only uses what's needed for a project. Aside from that, I've done some deep learning on [progressive web apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and automatting a [webpage performance report](http://danielmall.com/articles/how-to-make-a-performance-budget/).\n\nLast and not least, I got my first custom surfboard made by [Caleb, 'Critter Surfboards'](https://www.instagram.com/critterssurfboards/).\n\n<figure class=\"width--content\">\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-2/new-surfboard.jpg?fit=crop&w=700&h=700&auto=format\" alt=\"My Critter Surfboard, January 14, 2017\" />\n</figure>\n\n",

It's almost felt Spring like! The result is more—more surfing, more riding bikes and even still a little time to skateboard and rock climb. Besides enjoying the year's first sunny days, I released [ScrollDir](https://dollarshaveclub.github.io/scrolldir/) and continues to research into what I'm calling **story projects**. **Story projects**, 3 are started, are basically versions of serverside rendering capable boilerplate blog sites with different frontend MVCs.\n\n## ScrollDir, scroll direction detection\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-3/scrolldir.png?w=800&h=400&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Vertical scroll direction without jitter\" />\n</figure>\n\nA few months ago, I had a projects which required me to perfectly maintain scroll direction for showing and hiding user interface elements based on scroll direction. In writing something basic to do this, my co-worker [Patrick Fisher](https://github.com/pwfisher) mentioned that he'd written a [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin for this a few years ago. I implemented plugin into my project and it worked perfectly so we modernized it a bit for current JavaScript standards. The end result was ScrollDir. ScrollDir kills the need for developers needing to worry about a tool for maintaining vertical scroll direction. It's lightweight and easy to include in projects.\n\n## Roads seem clearest \n\n> Roads seem clearest when illuminated by light piercing through darkness\n\nOver the last couple of weeks I've been really concerned about the state of the world. Not going into that here, I'll say I've been looking to the outdoors for hope. The photo below was taken up off of Angeles Crest highway. \n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-3/angeles-highway.jpg?w=2000&h=1500&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Angeles Highway\" />\n</figure>\n",

To more closely mimic my team, I decided to make the switch from Sublime 3 (another text editor) to Atom.\n\n## Initial Feelings\n\nMy initial take on Atom was that beautiful—more beautiful out-of-the-box than Sublime and I liked that. I started to invest time learning quick keys. Over time, I noticed that Sublime had out of the box features that were not available with Atom—like drag-and-drop.  Avoiding dragging is important but for *_1 thing_ I do a lot I couldn't find a solution and dragging seems easier for me. \n\n> *RE: 1 thing: With an Atom Window open I could not figure out a way to drag-and-drop a new project folder into its sidebar. \n\nBeyond that, I found Atom to be slow and a memory hog. I've heard the debate that Sublime can become slow when a lot of plugins are added but I've never seen or felt that. \n\n## I am more productive with Sublime\n\nAfter a few months of feeling like I wasn't as productive with Atom, I decided to switch back to Sublime. I started re-learning my quick keys and then looking into some of the features that I liked about Atom—to see if I could add them with a plugin in Sublime.\n\n## Making Sublime as beauitful as Atom\n\nI love Atom's out of the box beauty. I've found that it only takes a few minutes to get Sublime to take on the features I enjoy.\n\n1. File Icons: I doubt that file icons came with Atom but that's were I first saw them. With the plugin [a-file-icon](https://github.com/ihodev/a-file-icon) I was able to achieve that. \n\n2. A new app icon: even though I personally didn't mind the Sublime icons there are some out there that just great. I updated the Sublime App icon with this great [replacement](https://github.com/YabataDesign/sublime-text-icon) from [José María Clemente](https://github.com/YabataDesign)\n\n3. A sweet font: watching [Wes Bos's](http://wesbos.com/) videos caused me to wonder about that awesome font he uses ([Operator](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator)) as an editor font. I don't have the $270 for Operator on my home and work computer so I went with a another recommendation from [him](http://wesbos.com/programming-fonts/) called [m-2m](http://www.fontspace.com/m-fonts/m-2m).\n\n## Adding things I liked from Atom to Sublime\n\n-  For adding file icons, and an awesome them I went to the sublime package manager and downloaded them. I recommend the [material theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) b/c I it transitions between regular and italic fonts and has a nice sweet of supporting features—linke icons for files.\n- Sublime Text > Preferences > Package Control\n\n-  For adding a new app icons, I went [here](https://github.com/YabataDesign/sublime-text-icon) and followed the steps\n  -  click download\n  -  open /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/Resources/\n  -  replace Sublime Text.icns\n  -  right click on the Sublime Text App > select 'get info'\n  -  drag the downloaded 'Sublime Text.icns' over the deafult icon in the top left corner\n-  For changing the font, first I downloaded a font, [m-2m](http://www.fontspace.com/m-fonts/m-2m). Then I updated my Sublime Settings.\n  -  download and install the font\n  -  Sublime Text (nav) > Preferences > Settings \n\n  **Here's the JSON:**\n```javascript\n{\n\"font_face\": \"mplus-2m-medium\",\n  \"font_options\":\n  [\n    \"gray_antialias\",\n    \"subpixel_antialias\"\n  ],\n  \"font_size\": 17.0\n}\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nAtom is great. I really like how it is built but I like Sublime more for. It's easy to get caught up in the churn of trying new tools. I'm glad I went back to Sublime because it is still just the best (for me right now). 💛\n\n\n\n",

It's important for me to remember these categories when learning about projects so that I can optimize my time spent learning, building and tooling with JavaScript. Currently (2017), JavaScript churn is real and it is easy to be overwhelmed. I find that when I break down JavaScript projects into these categories, I'm able to invest my time appropriately and pick tools faster. \n\n## The Core 4\n\n-  Plugins 🔌\n-  Libraries 📚\n-  Frameworks 🖼\n-  Services 🔧\n\n## Core 4 Definitions\n\n🔌&nbsp;&nbsp;**Plugins:** are a small usable functions. They should mainly do 1 thing and be usable across a wide spectrum of Frameworks, Libraries, and Services. If I can't make a plugin work within several minutes, then I move on. \n\n📚&nbsp;&nbsp;**Libraries:** are groups of utilities. Examples of projects I consider libraries are [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [LoDash](https://lodash.com/). Libraries create ways for their users to more easily do things like manipulate html. I find I change Libraries minimally so I tend to go for rock solid products that are stable and well documented.\n\n🖼&nbsp;&nbsp;**Frameworks:** are projects like [Angular](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). They establish patterns for writing entire systems of code. Frameworks are the cornerstone of products I build so when choosing a framework I build little apps and think about how that Framework's functionality will apply to the project I will be using it for. I invest a few days into understanding the basics of a Framework to make sure it's the right choice for a product.\n\n🔧&nbsp;&nbsp;**Services:** are things like compilers, task runners, or bundlers ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) or [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)). Services make it easier to build Frameworks, Libraries and Plugins. Services support the other 3 categories of JavaScript projects so time spent working on them is during configuration. I usually spend a few hours configuring Services for projects. \n\n## Summary\n\nSeparating JavaScript Projects into 4 categories gives my brain a digestible way to approach JavaScript projects. It's very easy to hop on twitter and read about new awesome things and feel overwhelmed. When binging on new things, it's nice to bucket them into categories to manage time spent learning versus time spent building. 🚀\n\n**Update:** Every single person that has read this post thinks that I am wrong and has valid strong opinions on why. Wanna [tweet](//twitter.com/share?url=https://jeffry.in{{ page.url }}&text={{ page.title }}&via={{ site.twitter_username }}) about it? Please do! 🙏\n",

There were negotiations going on and I built a major analytics update for the site that I'm been working on. Outside of tech, I had some good runs and spent some time at Leo Carillo Beach.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-5/leo-carillo-stream.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Leo Carillo Rock and Stream at Leo Carillo State Beach in California.\" />\n</figure>\n\n## Updating Analytics\nAnalytics for the site I'm working on had a straightworward facelift. Or teams are also working on tool to make analytics more uniform across our web properties. \n\n## Fitness Work\nI wasn't able to surf as much because of continued rain. I made it to the rock gym a few times and my aparment gym a few more times. I got onto my bike and ran for a few [hours](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201705&interval_type=week&chart_type=miles&year_offset=0) as well. \n\n## Leo Cabrillo State Beach\n\nDriving by Leo Cabrillo State Beach on Highway 1 has always been enjoyable. There's a rock that juts out from the ocean and appears to be battling longboarder waves 24 hours a day. Also, if there's been any rain, a stream flows out into the ocean. These are nice features of a beach. I had never really explored the beach beyond these observations though. I did that this week. Just north of the rocks and stream that is observable from highway are a few rock caves. The whole scene—the waves, the stream and the rock cave are memorable. I'm very glad I went.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-5/leo-carillo-cave.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Looking through a rock cave at Leo Carillo State Beach in California.\" />\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n",

I pushed my 3000th commit of the year on Github which was very important for me. At work, we released major analytics updates and I began working on some simpler things that can really improve performance—like code splitting. \n\n## Rain In Southern California\n\nOne of my best friends, [Quitin Radford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quintinradford), founder of [Uensil](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/903862437/sporklettm-0) and his wife Jill (who I would now call a friend) came and visited. They went surfing with me at Venice Beach's Breakwater without wetsuits because I didn't have extras which were pretty impressive because the water is frigid in February. Jill paddled out first. Other surfers didn't know what to think. They were chuckling subtly under their breath. Until she started charging waves. She didn't seem to care about the weather at all. It was inspiring. I think the whole beach was stoked!\n\nWe had more rain the day after our surf adventure. This particular rain was called [The Storm of the Decade](http://www.businessinsider.com/los-angeles-storm-rain-california-2017-2). Quintin, Jill and I went out to surf just before the storm and realized quickly that that would have been a bad idea. We, instead, went up the coast on Highway 1 to enjoy the storm from the ocean caves around [Leo Carillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Carrillo). It was a fantastic moment—one that I will not forget. \n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-6/quintin-jill.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Leo Carillo Rock and Stream at Leo Carillo State Beach in California.\" />\n</figure>\n\n## 3000 Commits on Github and 2.5k Stars\n\nI'm thankful for my line of work and the teams I work with.  I sometimes feel like I don't fit the mold of the work that I do. Tools like Github point out—'Hey, this person gets shit done!' And I do. I will continue to release simple usable open source projects and commit at a rapid rate for the projects that I'm working on. It makes me feel good to have tools that show my value. Thanks, Github!\n\n## Building Analytics Products\n\nBesides my own little Github atta-boy, we released an analytics update to the product that I've been working on which went smashingly well. This result is from our team's great communication on this project. I continue to find that when communication is in sync with project goals—the code needed is much easier to write. \n\n## Conclusion, I'm thankful full a lot this week\n\nI'm very thankful that I got to meet Jill, Quintin's wife. She is definitely who I hoped for in a partner for my good friend. I'm also thankful to be able to do the work that I do. I hope over this year I'm able to write more open source plugins and tools that people find valuable and continue to be a valued contributor to my team.\n\n\n\n",

I was able to surf quite a bit. I went climbing at the gym 3 times. I did a soft launch of an open source project I've been thinking about for a while called [Stickybits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits). Meanwhile, [Scrolldir](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/scrolldir) got to 100 stars on github.\n\n## Surfin\n\nSurfing was a lot of fun this week for me. Monday was bigger, so we (Jon and I) surfed at Sunset for 4 hours. I was able to get into some corners really nice. \n\nI surfed Venice on Wednesday and Thursday. Wednesday was fun with a bunch of peeler waves. Thursday, was a really interesting day. A sandbar cliff had been created on shore. Waves were going into shore, hitting the sandbar cliff, and going back out with a similar force that they had come in with and hitting another incoming wave. This whould cause the incoming wave to grow in size suddenly. What this meant for surfing was fun jumpy waves. \n\nOn Saturday, I went to Ventura Point. The wave were small and fun. There were small logs and twigs in the water so it wasn't the cleanest.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-7/sunset-waves.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Waves at Sunset on President's Day\" />\n</figure>\n\n## Climbing\n\nI've continued to enjoy climbing indoors at Cliffs of Id. I'm able to do most v-2s which is still beginner. However, I'm able to do beginner bouldering routes (v-0, v-1, v-2 and some v-3s) for longer and at a faster rate.\n\n## Open Source Products\n\nI did a soft launch of Stickybits which is an open source project I've been working on for a while. Stickybits basically checks for `position: sticky` support and if the browser doesn't support sticky, the plugin loosely mimics `position: sticky` with `position: fixed`. \n\n[Scrolldir](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrolldir) has continued to be a powerful utility plugin that I'm happy to have helped publish. \n\n## Conclusion, a bit of everything\n\nThis was another good week of surfing, climbing and writing open source. I'm looking forward to publishing the landing page StickyBits and moving on to writing more utility plugins and supporting my team more in their open source projects. \n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-7/running-from-water.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Running From Water at Leo Cabrillo\" />\n</figure>\n",

Lauren Schlueter was a friend of mine who helped\n  me through laughter.

When she arrived in Manhattan Beach, where I lived, we became fast friends. At the time, I was recovering from a serious bout with Pneumonia. The sickness had left me a bit depressed. She was going through some life changes making us the perfect travel/hang-out duo.\n{: .first-paragraph}\n\nAfter meeting, we immediately discussed politics and history. Normal stuff, right? 😂 She was passionate about certain things, like Cuba. These certain things she could describe in great detail which I enjoyed listening to for hours. We enjoyed debating certain points. I learned a from her responses. \n\nShe had a lot to say about several television shows, like Game of Throwns and Bob's Burgers. I know many people watch a lot of television shows—but not like Lauren. She could converse, debate and laugh about each episode of a show she watched in detail. I would watch shows just to connect the dots of the stories Lauren would tell about shows. \n\nThe first trip that she roped me into was from Chicago to Orlando in the dead of winter. I don't know why she asked me to go but we went. We left Chicago in a blizzard and I remember thinking, 'This is a horrible idea! Why am I doing this?'. We stopped in Memphis and listened to blues before heading further South—to the Gulf of Mexico. \n\nI remember arrving to the Gulf of Mexico and asking if we could watch the sunset from the Gulf. We went to an old lighthouse. The water was so calm; much more calm than I ever see in the Pacific. Lauren walked to shore facing the sun as it set> She buckled her knees (as she would) and crossed her arms. She looked almost mad at first. Then she took in a deep breath and it seemed that her whole body melted in view. It was the best sunset. At that moment, I was so glad I was on that trip. After, I arriving in Orlando I assumed I wouldn't see her again. She had made plans to be a teacher abroad in Doha. \n\nA few weeks later, she reached out with a request to drive to Big Sur—a place she had wanted to go to and a favorite place of mine. She came back to California and we drove up the coast staying in Santa Barbara, Monterey, and Morro Bay. It was a memorable trip. Lauren left to teach in Doha after. \n\nLauren and I would touch base after she moved to Doha—to reflect on our trips, what was up in our lives and reminisce a bit about fun times we'd had. She'd seemed well and that made me happy. I felt like we'd grown so much together. For myself, I'd learned how to live my life outside of who I'd been before Pneumonia. The new me was a bit more accepting of myself and I am thankful for what I learned from Lauren. I felt a stronger desire to just-enjoy-stuff and accept the people I care about for who the are &middot;and were. \n\nI'll never forget Lauren for that and our trips. She will live on in my mind; appreciating sunsets—accepting a landscape so much that she seems to become a part of it, like that moment at the Gulf of Mexico. She will be missed. I'll always see a bit of her in every sunset I watch—its quite good-bye mixed with fiery light. I'll miss you Lauren Schlueter. \n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/losing-a-friend/gulf-of-mexico.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Lauren at the Gulf of Mexico\" />\n</figure>\n",

I was sick the whole week so I sat A LOT. Besides sitting a lot, a few friends started on new adventures and a close friend of mine passed away. Workwise, I started working on some cool analytics stuff and I'm continuing to work on some cool open source products.\n\n## Fighting the flu\n\nI became fully sick on Monday which I faught through and went to work. I regret that decision but I was able to make Tuesday way worse (sarcasm)! I just kept getting more sick after that. On Friday, I went to Urgent Care and from there—it worked out well. I was worried that I had pneumonia so I was happy to learn that I only had the flu! The good doctors gave me medication and I spent the weekend recovering.\n\n## Moving on\n\nI had a dear friend of mine pass away. It's been on my mind all week. I'd met this person at the beginning of 2014 and we'd gone on some epic trips together. She helped me a lot with laughter. I first met her when I was recovering from pneumonia. Before having pneumonia I was able to do several things that I haven't been able to do after—like run several miles pretty fast. I was pretty depressed about this change and then my friend made fun of me, \"But you can still run, right?\". She was right. Her vibes about my recovery made me feel okay to complain—because it was like a joke when she'd make fun of me. Her attitube also motivated me to heal. I'm very thankful for her outlook. I'll nver forget it.\n\n## Analytics and Open Source\n\nI'm switching over to an analytics project and I'm pumped about it. I'd started working on a product for this project a while ago and I'm happy to be working on something that is a bit more data/javascript heavy. As far as open source, I hope to do the landing page for [stickybits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits) this week which will be fun.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nI'm thankful for my life and the goals I have to attain. I feel like I have so much more to say in this life. I hope my words will reflect a bit of what I learned from my dear friend that passed. I'll miss her forever and try to remember the gifts I received from her. \n\n",

They seem simple to write in discussion. Yet, when changing multiple files or things in a file, the meaning of changes can be lost easily. Following the AWW formula helps composing meaning when committing. \n",

While making them, I've had a few _a-ha_ moments. \n\n## A-ha Moments 💭\n**Plugins should be simple.** Their functionality should be all that matters. Making them as usuable as possible is key. \n\n**Open source and 'Plugins'** are loosely defined in the Open Source community—which I hope will change. Here's how I define [Plugins](https://jeffry.in/4-categories-js-projects/) within the JavaScript eco-system. There was heavy debate, even with my friends about that post—which I think pointed to the fact that _plugins are loosely defined_.\n\n## Plugins Should Be Simple 💁\n\n_JavaScript plugins should be simple_! It should be easy to setup plugins to do the thing that they are supposed to do. Between downloading and integration, plugins should take only several minutes to understand, implement and try out.\n\nA simple plugin works within the functionality of larger JavaScript eco-systems. Featurization of a plugin should not extend far beyond the problem that the plugin solves and should probably just focus it's usability within a larger eco-system—not extended options.\n\nIn example, there is a current gap between thousands of awesome jQuery Plugins and the way that people are writing code today. Now people are re-writing jQuery Plugins to be Plugins for Frameworks, like React and Ember. In other words, with the rapidness that JavaScript changes, plugins that are built for a Framework or Library can be a very hard thing for the community to keep up with. Plugins offer true utility when they can work and be used across other JavaScript projects with minimal effort.\n\nTo accomplish this with the plugins I've worked on, I try to write them in as plain of JavaScript as possible and try to offer the ability for other JavaScript projects to easily intergrate with them.\n\nWith these few lines of code, I've allowed for jQuery and Zepto to be used for Reframe.js and Shave.\n\n```javaScript\n\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n  const plugin = window.$ || window.jQuery || window.Zepto;\n  if (plugin) {\n    plugin.fn.shave = function shavePlugin(maxHeight, opts) {\n      shave(this, maxHeight, opts);\n      return this;\n    };\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nA really cool thing about writing code this way is that all of the code be tree shaken if unneeded. As JavaScript Services like Webpack and Rollup become more advanced Plugins can be more modifiable to serve the user of the plugin.\n\n## Functionality Is What Matters 📈\n\nA plugin's users should be able to understand its code but trust that it works. Featurization should not extend far beyond the problem that the plugin solves. \n\nTo understand this concept, I think of [carousels](http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/). Carousel's whether hot or not are still implemented by many companies. When looking for a carousel, it is very easy to find carousel plugins that offer extensive tooling. It's cool to go through their demo pages but how much is each user going to use all of the carousel options? If the user cannot tree shake the unneeded options then they are forced to add code to support features that they do not use. This should be improved!\n\nSo, when making or looking for plugins, I suggest trying to support a simple function and making that function's options support usability of that function rather then features that may not be needed. If you like to offer featuring options, it should be important to make sure that unnused features can be removed or unincluded by treeshaking or in a build step of the plugin.\n\n## Plugins Should Be Usable 🛠\n\nUsers of a JavaScript plugin should be able to require it, wrap it and treeshake it to make it truly only do what it is supposed to do! When making plugins, focus should on the extension of it wrather then its options. \n\nWhen providing options, I often use options as a way to remove any trace of the plugin itself. From there, I may try to provide ways to make the plugin extendable. If the extension of an extendable bit of code reaches too far—it makes sense to write another plugin. This helps with the plugin's simplicity and functionality. \n\n## Why make small plugins? \nI've been making small plugins to support larger JavaScript projects or for simple use. I look for opportunities to minimize my code by seeing if I can simplify what's out there or if I find a great jQuery plugin and simplify it with ES6. \n\n## In Conclusion, Make Plugins! 🚀\n\nIn conclusion, I try to make plugins. Maybe at some point I'll discover a reason to make a framework or library but for right now, plugins that consist of a few simple functions are very usable and extendable. I'm learning a lot for how I can build plugins to be smaller and more usable. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

After writing a few open source plugins, I've realized that readability is very important to get help and make code better. One area where readability becomes confusing is options code. In this short post, I will go over options code in JavaScript Plugins and how it can be improved. \n{: .first-paragraph}\n\n## What are options?\n\n> Options, in JavaScript, are arguements passed in a function to replace default properties values.\n\nOptions, in JavaScript, are arguements passed in a function to replace default properties values. In example, sometimes a plugin will have a default css class that it is associated with. Plugins will often allow users to change this default css class. \n\nHere an example of how options look in JavaScript from ES5:\n\n```javaScript\nfunction someFunction(opts) {\n  var defaults = {\n    el: document.documentElement,\n    win: window,\n    attribute: 'data-some-attr'\n  };\n  var el = opts && opts.el || defaults.el;\n  var win = opts && opts.win || defaults.win;\n  var attribute = opts && opts.attribute || defaults.attribute;\n  // for exampe perposes\n  return console.log({\n    element: el,\n    document: win,\n    attr: attribute\n  });\n};\n```\n\nAnd here's how it can be changed when it is initiated:\n\n```javaScript\nsomeFunction({attribute: 'data-attr'});\n```\n\nThe _log_ will now looking something like: \n\n```javaScript\n  Object: attr: \"data-attr\", document: Window, element: html\n```\n\n## Defined Options Is Confusing\n\nThe `options` code above is confusing! I mean, what the heck is going on here?\n```javaScript\nvar el = opts && opts.el || defaults.el;\n```\n\nThis code needs an `el` property. It says, define the `el` property from `opts` (passed in from a function) or get the default `el` value. That's a lot of work to make sure that a property has a value.\n\n## Option Readability Can Be Improved With ES6\n\nES6, with function destructuring allows us to make options code more readable.\n\nWith ES6, we can write this:\n\n```javaScript\nfunction someFunction({\n  el = document.documentElement,\n  win = window,\n  attribute = 'data-some-attr' } = {}) {\n  return console.log({\n    element: el,\n    document: win,\n    attr: attribute\n  });\n};\n```\n\nAnd then add any custom opts with:\n\n```javaScript\nsomeFunction({attribute: 'data-attr'});\n```\n\nThis trims down the reference to a poperty value to 2 times versus 3!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith ES6 function destructuring, options code is much cleaner and easier to read. As a result Open Source Plugins that use this feature are easier to improve and understand.\n\n\n",

I feel more emotional and humbled after being sick but this week _the feels_ were deeper. I'm transitioning work teams, was reminiscing about my friend Lauren who passed away, and continued learning how to surf.\n\n## Changing Teams\n\nChanging teams is emotional for me. I put a lot into my work—all of myself for at least a full work day and usually after (by choice). Even though my teammates are usually still around I miss the experience of them working how we were. I grow attached to the ways that I was working. It's hard. Besides my working with my last team, there's always a learning curve with a new team and I feel unsure of myself because there I know there are a lot of things that I don't know. \n\n## Getting Back to Surfing\n\nBeing sick for a week and a half, I wasn't able to surf. I missed being in the water. I also want to improve. I still have a long ways to go to get to where I'd like to be surfing so time off is hard. \n\nI was able to get back in the water on Friday the 10th. I went to Venice and dropped in on a few smaller waves which is the main thing that I'm working on currently. \n\nI want to be able to drop in on waves better. I've been afraid of this part of surfing b/c I often eat shit when I try and swallow a bunch of water as well. It's not fun and swallowing a lot of water can lead to getting sick. \n\nOn Saturday the 11th, I went to surf El Porto with my friend Justin but decided because of crowds that I would try a different spot. I went to Sunset and found that there were hardly any surfings and a bunch of 1-2ft waves—great for dropping in. \n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-9/wave-rocks-3.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Waves at Sunset on a foggy day\" />\n</figure>\n\nSunday, the 12th, I surfed Venice. There were 1-4ft waves. They were a bit bigger than Sunset the day before which allowed me to test my drop-in training. I dropped in on what I think may have been a 3ft wave—probably my biggest drop-in. I dropped in on several more waves and swallowed water several times. I found myself wanting to push myself which I had not felt surfing yet but I'm embracing it. \n\n## Feeling Beta\n\nA feeling that I was thinking through this week a lot was that of feeling beta. When I write _feeling beta_ I mean _feeling like I'm placing second in a lot of people's minds_. \n\nI was feeling beta because I was not feeling 100% and because there was language that was communicated to me this week that made me feel _less than_ the person that was communicating to me. \n\nI actually, within myself, like the feeling of _being beta_ once in a while. It tells me that my ego is motivated to improve. I'm looking forward improving in some places that I would like to. Also, the things that made me feel this way communicate to me that last week and future weeks will be a time of silent growth. \n\nIt was a great week! I feel like I have a lot to look forward to over the next weeks. I have some things that I'm excited about learning and doing. \n\n\n",

I got some good surfing time on a new fun board and\n  I felt more comfortable in my new position at work.\nfeatured_image: \"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-11/jetty-1.jpg\"\nshare_image: null\ncategories:\n- note\n- story\n---\n\nLast week was the 3rd week of March, 2017. I was able to have some fun surfing later in the week. I continued to progress in my transfer from 1 team to another at work. Also, my car was side-swiped while I was at Dinner in Venice. All in all, it was a fair week—considering the car side-swiping.\n\n## Changing Teams\n\nChanging teams is tough but great for challenging new skills and learning. The product that I was working on before (a [content](https://content.dollarshaveclub.com/) site) still exists leading to fair amount of continued conversation on that product. Meanwhile, I have a whole new stack, (an analytics tool) that I'm working on now. The really cool part of this setup is that I get to work on a lot of things. The not as cool part [for right now], is the amount of different things I'm working on is almost too much to take on all at once. It's a lot for my brain to consume and comprehend when there is context switching between old progress, new team dynamics, new tools and new skills that I need to learn. In this case, 'context switching' means changing up a thought process and/or workflow a lot. \n\nAs far as what I'm learning, I'm getting much more comfortable with Docker. I'm also getting a crash course in debugging. The best thing I've done so far is destroy my local dev box version needlessly a few times and disconnect my local MySQL for the content site which does not run on docker. It hasn't been the most fun but I've gained a lot from debugging and I've been able to work with more developers—very cool.\n\n## Surfing Time\n\nLate the week before last, I was getting out of the water and over extended my leg a bit so I wasn't able to surf. This was good for focusing my time on learning my new workflow at work but still a bummer. \n\nThen the weekend came and my body was feeling pretty good. I added fins and a leash to my new fun board—a 7'2\" for small wave days. The new board took some getting used to but after a few perls, I was able to get some fun long rides in on Saturday and Sunday. \n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-11/jetty-1.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Jetty in Playa Del Ray\" />\n</figure>\n\n## Getting Side-swiped\n\nI've often heard that part of being an Angeleno is dealing with what happens when your car incurs damage when parked. Well, if that is the case then I'm officially an Angeleno. I went to dinner on Sunday and came back to tripping on something while getting ready to get into my car. The thing that I tripped on was my side view mirror. Upon closer inspection of my car in the darkness (it was night), my side view mirror was off and it had scratches from my front bumper, on both side doors, and my rear bumper. After going to the body shop I learned it was well over a $1k in damages. The person that ran into my car left no note so 100% of the cost was on me—or so I thought. \n\nAfter going to my local body shop, they informed me that I could contact my insurance without filing a claim if I stated, 'I didn't want to file a claim' when the conversation started. So I did that and found the insurance company to be very helpful. After discussing my car issue with my insurance, I found I would only have to pay the co-pay of my damages plus my insurance would not go up! \n\nAll-in-all, I learned new things from side-swipe situation. It is going to cost me about $600 after it's all said and done—WAY better than what I thought.\n\n## Concluding the week\n\nThis week will go down as fair because, 'darn-it'—being injured and having my car side-swiped was not fun. However, on the level of learning, it was a big week for me! 🙃\n\n\n",

It is a slightly less known mountain town when compared with other towns in a close proximity—like Big Bear. Near to Wrightwood are group of rocks called 'The Mormon Rocks'.

We're were on the verge of releasing our new version and creating better test coverage.\nOutside of work, I found time to surf and get to the gym. We had a 3 day weekend so I surfed all 3 days and went down the coast to surf Encinitas.\n\n## Analytics and Stickybits\n\nThe ramp up time to productivity on the analytics project is taking some time. The team is good. We just have to get all parts of the team machine firing—and in unison. Last week, I began to see this happening. I'm hoping to see more and faster products gains in the following weeks. \n\n[Stickybits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits), my most recent User Interface Open Source project is reaching maturity and I've been working hard on promoting it. Not having many followers in the tech space makes that tough but I've started to make gains which is good because I've put some time in understanding `position: sticky` and thinking about it's benefits.\n\n## I've been surfing a lot lately\n\nSurfing has been great for me. I started a few years ago with my roommate at that time, [Garret Martucci](http://garretmartucci.com/). Garret and I were living in [Manhattan Beach, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Beach,_California) so we headed down to beach and surfed a few times. After Garret and I moved out, I stopped surfing before I had really started. Fast forward a few years, I met my friend and co-worker [Justin Berg](http://justinintime.com/). We started meeting before work and surfing. Before I knew it, I was going surfing as much as I could. \n\nAs of now, I've been surfing a lot since last September. It challenges and gives me satisfaction. I find even on the days I struggle catching waves or get into a wave just right, I'm given the opportunity to get frustrated in the ocean by myself—and I _usually_ get a better work out. 🙃 Then, some days, I feel something new 'click' and my mind is opened to something new I enjoy about surfing. This past weekend, turning left started to 'click' for me. It felt exhilarating and empowering to be able to consider going either way on a wave (left or right).\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-14/carlsbad-1.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Jetty in Playa Del Ray\" />\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The week after, I stayed above Ojai on Highway 33. I've surfed most days over these past 3 weeks and have still maintained productivity coding.\n{: .first-paragraph}\n\n## Staying in Ojai\n\nHighway 33 above Ojai is a beautiful road leading to several beautiful places, like [Rosewood Falls](https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/rose-valley-falls-padres/). It runs along a few streams and goes from sea level to over 6k ft. I've cycled on it and I've now camped along it. Something that I really enjoy about it is it's difference from Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains. Where Malibu is mainly shrubbery, along Highway 33 there are several steams and as the road evalates, the landscape changes to the point that when I've been to the road's highest point—I've been above the clouds and it's been below freezing.\n\n2 weeks ago, while staying there, I made sure to park in an overnight hiking spot so I was able to camp and go with ease. I was slightly nervous because I didn't have cel service and was definitely along but that also made the trip exciting. In the morning, I was able to drive down the into Ventura to surf with ease. \n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-13/hwy-33.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Jetty in Playa Del Ray\" />\n</figure>\n\n## Staying pitted (not really)\ncod\nI've been lucky, I think a lot because of maintaining activity in several sports, to feel pretty healthy. Feeling healthy has allowed me to surf more. 2 weeks ago, I surfed Sunset a few times during the week and [Mondos](https://www.wannasurf.com/spot/North_America/USA/California/Ventura/Mondos/) over the weekend. I was able to get some decent rides and am showing improvements going let on waves. I'm currently work on improving my setup time to catch waves as well a getting myself into more optimal situations to catch waves at their best. \n\n## Staying productive\n\nSwitching products, learning, and maintaining projects seems like a lot and **is** a lot for me. I feel like I'm constantly trying to find balance between learning, building, and helping others. Helping others often helps my learn however I still bucket it separately because time involved is definitely not the same as time spent learning on my own, digging through docs and grokking code. \n\nMaking the decision to travel over the weekend has taken away from time learning and working on my own projects. I'm still trying to figure out my perfect balance of time spent away from the computer and time in front of it. My goal is to enjoy days away from the computer but find time to reflect on my weekly learnings. \n\n## Conclusion\n\n2 weeks ago was good. Finding ways to camp is helping me to save money so that I can travel more. I'm still trying to balance traveling and learning. My goals is to focus on reflective learning while I travel. \n",

Growing happiness and optimizing my time are the same—if I optimize my time, I have more time to do things that make me happy. I try assess how happy I am and what is not making me happy often. \n\nI know that its time to make my happiness level assessment when I have unhappy. Unhappiness is a very abstract thing. It is not factual or logical. It is good to have unhappy feelings. Unhappy feelings stress what is not working or what needs to be worked on. In the past, I would have feelings of unhappiness but I would not think about why I was unhappy logically. This caused me to feel unhappy longer. It caused me feel powerless to change my unhappiness. I was reliant on unhappy situations to end by themselves or change outside of the scope of my control.\n\n4 years ago, I realized that if I thought through why I was feeling unhappy—really breaking down what was not going well—that I was able to either accepts the problems or make a conscious effort to fix it.\n\nThere are steps I follow and questions I ask to address my unhappy feelings. \n\n-  I address potential physical issues\n   -  Am I having physical pains that might be associated with my feelings?\n   -  Am I having physical ailments that could be leading me to have unhappy feelings?\n   -  How's my sleep schedule been?\n-  What is a realistic worst case scenario of my unhappy feelings? \n   -  What are my options if that scenario happens?\n   -  What is the actual probability of that scenario happening?\n-  What is a realistic time line to a resolution of my unhappy feelings?\n-  Who can I share theses feelings with that will be respectful yet honest?\n\nDigging into the worst case scenario, for me, makes it a problem to be solved rather than something that is an abstract unhappy feeling. I am able to think of alternate options, possible benefits and every time so far—I've realized that the worst case scenario is not very realistic. \n\nLast week, I was having some unhappy feelings. I thought about why. I had suffered an ankle injury. I had projects that seemed bleek. My team seemed stressed. Taking the time to think about these things relaxed me. Rather than thinking about my sucky situation, I began to think about solutions. I talked to a few people as soon as I could about it. Together, we assessed my feelings and then solutions. The result, so far, has been more productivity which has lead to more fun for me. \n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-20/beach.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Brian and Lala at Sunset Beach\" />\n</figure>\n",

It seemed like only a few days ago that I was walking the streets of Prague—where I lived in high school. I often times reflect on my time alive and realize that there are so many moments that have disappeared to me. Yet, I can live in a worm-hole of just a few seconds for years. I try to keep that in mind everyday. I try to look for moments that will last and be productive during all of the time that doesn't matter much to me.  \n",

It is where people riding waves want to be while riding\nfeatured_image: null\nshare_image: null\ncategories:\n- note\n- story\n---\n\nOver the past 9 months, I've made an effort to become a better surfer. Surfing has been enjoyable, therapeutic and humbling. Riding waves while standing on my feet has been only a small part of my learning. I've had to learn to swim with a surfboard, how to balance my core while paddling, how to balance while sitting and how to attempt to stand while dropping into waves. Most of the past months has been about small progressions and basic new understandings. The goal I've been striving for while learning to surf is to be in the face of the wave before it breaks or after it has broken on the face in the area that is called the corner. \n\nIf I'm standing in the face of the waves, I'm ahead of the break. Metaphorically, I'm ahead of an end. Not only that, I'm defining my destiny. As I've been able to get into the face of waves more and for longer, I've felt amazing feelings: I'm ahead of the end; I'm defining my destiny—at least for a very short time. It's great!\n",
