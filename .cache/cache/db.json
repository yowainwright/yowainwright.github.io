You expect a mall to have stores for shoes, stores for electronics &#x26; potentially restaurants for food after you’ve become hungry from going to a bunch of stores.</p>\n<p>Javascript scope can be viewed like a mall. We could say that the mall is <em>global</em> or that it is the <em>global scope</em> which means that you can access all that the mall has to offer. However, people, or me at least, don’t go to a mall for to walk around in it’s large amount of space, we go for stores with specific it’s at specialized stores.</p>\n<p>We can consider these specialized stores the <em>local scope</em> which means that when we go to ‘a shoe store’ we have access to shoes there but not food &#x26; when we go to a restaurant, we have access to food but not shoes.</p>\n<p>When we go into that shoe store, we’re still at the mall &#x26; can get certain information from the mall - like that awesome mall music but we also have access to shoes (but not food). This idea is known as <em>Lexical Scope</em>. So Lexical Scope deals with where information can be accessed.</p>\n<p>As we go around to these stores &#x26; purchase things, eating food &#x26; interacting with people at the mall while listening to that awesome mall music we’re attaining ‘stuff’. We’re getting information from the music, perhaps purchasing goods from the store. We can think of that as the <em>Execution Context</em>. Execution Context is essentially, all of the stuff that we comes with &#x26; happens to us as we go there the mall. We keep the items that buy but, hopefully, forget some of the music that we listen to.</p>\n<h2>Now, Scope, seriously</h2>\n<p>To understand <strong>scope</strong>, we need to know about variables &#x26; how we store information. <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var\">Variables</a></strong> store bits of information in the key words <em>var</em>, <em><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let\">let</a></strong></em>, or <em><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const\">const</a></strong></em>.

I will not be discussing <em>const</em> anymore right now so forget I brought it up. <em>Let</em> is very similar to <em>var</em> to the point that I had to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/let-keyword-vs-var-keyword\">find</a> the difference: var is scoped to the nearest function scope which let is enclosed to the nearest closing block.</p>\n<p>Scope, in Javascript, refers to where stored information can be accessed.</p>\n<p><strong>4 commonly talked about scopes are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lexical Scope</li>\n<li>Global Scope</li>\n<li>Local Scope</li>\n<li>Execution Context</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lexical Scope</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/lexical-scoping-static-scoping\">Lexical</a> Scope refers to where a variables can be accessed within code blocks.</p>\n<h2>Global Scope</h2>\n<p><strong>Global</strong> Scope means that a variable was declared outside of a function so it can be accessed &#x26; modified throughout a program.</p>\n<h2>Local Scope</h2>\n<p>Local Scope refers the a variable that was declared within a function which means mean that it can only be accessed within that function.</p>\n<p><strong>example:</strong>\n{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>var globalVar = ‘This var is global’;\nvar myFunc = function() {\nvar localVar = ‘This var is local’;\n};\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<h2>Execution Context</h2>\n<p>Execution context is memory scope. It’s created as a program runs.</p>\n<p><strong>A fun example which demonstrates scope:</strong>\n{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>var makeArray = function() {\nreturn [];\n};\nvar array1 = makeArray();\nvar array2 = makeArray();</p>\n<p>console.log(array1 === array2); // returns false\n// it returns false b/c array1 &#x26; array2 are 2 different array objects\n// they have 2 different execution contexts</p>\n<p>console.log(array1 == array2); // also, returns false\n// == still returns false because the do not refer to the same object\n// <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3\">http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3</a> (1.f.)\n{% endhighlight  %}</p>\n<p>Javascript Scope, like a mall, is essential. It’s great walking through the mall but you’re not at Walmart. You want specialized items. You can walk around the mall &#x26; hear that mall music. That’s The Global Scope. You don’t want to go into a Footlocker to get shoes &#x26; walk out with a taco. You don’t go to Taco Bell to get the new J’s but if you could for the price of a taco - that’d be cool. Where you’re able to go to purchase shoes or a taco - that’s Lexical Scope. Anything that you buy or other interactions that happen as you go through the mall can be remembered as the execution context.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-23c794b47440695827e2896240c042dd-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>Chatting with a friend, we began discussing challenging things that had overcome in the past years.

I took the sec to say, ‘Wow! That painting is beautiful!‘. Little did I know that this statement would lead to a wild night and early morning!</p>\n<p>As I was leaving after a day of <em>data planning</em> the owner of the painting says, ‘bet that painting would look great on a wall in your house!‘. I agreed and we decided to wrap the painting in cloth &#x26; tie to my car safe and sound … Right? Wrong! I was driving on the 10 (Los Angeles Area Highway towards Downtown LA (where I currently live) and suddenly <em>Whoosh</em>. The painting was flying through the air. I was initially scared that it was going to cause problems but it landed flat on the front of a semi &#x26; immediately looked to explode.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/art-lived/art-lived-broken.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the painting after being hit\"></p>\n<p>When I got home, I called the person that had given me the painting &#x26; told him what happened. We sat on opposite ends of the phone silently for a sec. Then he goes, ‘Do you remember where on the highway the painting flew off?‘. Yup (I knew)! He says, ‘Come get me!‘. I go and pick him up &#x26; we go searching for the painting on the 10 [again, Los Angeles Highway (always busy)] &#x26; there it is sitting on the side of the Freeway. It might as well have been folded it was so perfect. We pull over &#x26; pick up the painting. As we are driving to the highway exit we hear a <em>whoop whoop whoop</em>. I had a flat tire. One of the wood chips from the painting’s frame had lodged itself right into my tire. The tire was flatten almost immediately.</p>\n<p>So there we were fixing a flat at about 3am on <em>Crenshaw</em>. Crenshaw is not the safest spot in LA to fix a flat. A gentleman walks by <em>looking down on his luck</em> &#x26; says, ‘your lucky … flats can be fixed!‘. He was right. I drove the owner of the painting home &#x26; before we bid our good byes he unfolded the painting &#x26; we looked at it - still beautiful. Art, for the night, lived!</p>\n<p>After scrambling to get my car fixed &#x26; other obligations, I didn’t have time for the <em>lemonade</em> picture post on Facebook but somehow I hoped that after sharing this story - it doesn’t matter. I think that recovering the painting was actually a better symbol &#x26; I hope that my friend feels the same.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/art-lived/art-lived-finished2.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the

IT IS THAT SIMPLE! But, understanding why they’re so important quickly become pretty complex.\n{: .first-paragraph}</p>\n<h2>JavaScript Closure by Example</h2>\n<p>The first thing that comes to mind when I try to think of an example to explain Javascript Closures is the process of microwaving. When we put something, food preferably, in a microwave, we’re expecting something tasty to come out after a few minutes. Well, maybe not tasty but definitely different.</p>\n<p>We can think of a Javascript Closure like a microwave. There’s an outer function, a chunk of re-usable code, which is represented by a microwave &#x26; an inner function which we could think of as the ‘thingy’ that cooks the food. </p>\n<p>We don’t want whatever is cooking that food, to cook us, so we put the food in the microwave (outer function) &#x26; then the actual ‘thingy’ that cooks the food (inner function). That encapsulated process that cooks the food is what &#x26; why we use a function.</p>\n<p>Closures are important because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can create private variables</li>\n<li>They have access to functions &#x26; variables of a higher scope</li>\n<li>They’re useful with time interval functions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gettin’ more serious about Closures</h2>\n<p>Javascript Closure is created when an inner function is made accessible from outside of it’s parent function. This is commonly done by returning the inner function. So like when you put food into the microwave &#x26; then get it out.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>\n{% highlight javascript %}\n// What are Closures?\nvar closureFunction = ‘Closer are functions ’;\nvar rememberWhat = ‘that remember ’;\nvar theirEnvironment = ‘the environment there were created in. ‘;</p>\n<p>var aVar = closureFunction;\nvar bVar = rememberWhat;\nvar cVar = theirEnvironment;</p>\n<p>// let’s make some sentences tat describe closure\nvar varA = aVar;\nvar anArray = [];\nvar outerFunction = function() {\nvar varB = bVar;\nanArray.push( function() {\nvar varC = cVar;\ndocument.write(varA + varB + varC);\n});\n};\nouterFunction();\nanArray<a href=\"\">0</a>;</p>\n<p>var varA = ‘Private variables ’;\nvar bVar = ‘can be accessed ’;\nvar cVar = ‘with closure. ’;\nouterFunction();\n//anArray<a href=\"\">0</a>;
