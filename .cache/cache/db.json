I agreed and we decided to wrap the painting in cloth &#x26; tie to my car safe and sound ... Right? Wrong! I was driving on the 10 (Los Angeles Area Highway towards Downtown LA (where I currently live) and suddenly <em>Whoosh</em>. The painting was flying through the air. I was initially scared that it was going to cause problems but it landed flat on the front of a semi &#x26; immediately looked to explode.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/art-lived/art-lived-broken.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the painting after being hit\"></p>\n<p>When I got home, I called the person that had given me the painting &#x26; told him what happened. We sat on opposite ends of the phone silently for a sec. Then he goes, 'Do you remember where on the highway the painting flew off?'. Yup (I knew)! He says, 'Come get me!'. I go and pick him up &#x26; we go searching for the painting on the 10 [again, Los Angeles Highway (always busy)] &#x26; there it is sitting on the side of the Freeway. It might as well have been folded it was so perfect. We pull over &#x26; pick up the painting. As we are driving to the highway exit we hear a <em>whoop whoop whoop</em>. I had a flat tire. One of the wood chips from the painting's frame had lodged itself right into my tire. The tire was flatten almost immediately.</p>\n<p>So there we were fixing a flat at about 3am on <em>Crenshaw</em>. Crenshaw is not the safest spot in LA to fix a flat. A gentleman walks by <em>looking down on his luck</em> &#x26; says, 'your lucky ... flats can be fixed!'. He was right. I drove the owner of the painting home &#x26; before we bid our good byes he unfolded the painting &#x26; we looked at it - still beautiful.

When we put something, food preferably, in a microwave, we're expecting something tasty to come out after a few minutes. Well, maybe not tasty but definitely different.</p>\n<p>We can think of a Javascript Closure like a microwave.

You expect a mall to have stores for shoes, stores for electronics &#x26; potentially restaurants for food after you've become hungry from going to a bunch of stores.</p>\n<p>Javascript scope can be viewed like a mall. We could say that the mall is <em>global</em> or that it is the <em>global scope</em> which means that you can access all that the mall has to offer. However, people, or me at least, don't go to a mall for to walk around in it's large amount of space, we go for stores with specific it's at specialized stores.</p>\n<p>We can consider these specialized stores the <em>local scope</em> which means that when we go to 'a shoe store' we have access to shoes there but not food &#x26; when we go to a restaurant, we have access to food but not shoes.</p>\n<p>When we go into that shoe store, we're still at the mall &#x26; can get certain information from the mall - like that awesome mall music but we also have access to shoes (but not food). This idea is known as <em>Lexical Scope</em>. So Lexical Scope deals with where information can be accessed.</p>\n<p>As we go around to these stores &#x26; purchase things, eating food &#x26; interacting with people at the mall while listening to that awesome mall music we're attaining 'stuff'. We're getting information from the music, perhaps purchasing goods from the store. We can think of that as the <em>Execution Context</em>. Execution Context is essentially, all of the stuff that we comes with &#x26; happens to us as we go there the mall. We keep the items that buy but, hopefully, forget some of the music that we listen to.</p>\n<h2>Now, Scope, seriously</h2>\n<p>To understand <strong>scope</strong>, we need to know about variables &#x26; how we store information. <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var\">Variables</a></strong> store bits of information in the key words <em>var</em>, <em><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let\">let</a></strong></em>, or <em><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const\">const</a></strong></em>.

I will not be discussing <em>const</em> anymore right now so forget I brought it up. <em>Let</em> is very similar to <em>var</em> to the point that I had to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/let-keyword-vs-var-keyword\">find</a> the difference: var is scoped to the nearest function scope which let is enclosed to the nearest closing block.</p>\n<p>Scope, in Javascript, refers to where stored information can be accessed.</p>\n<p><strong>4 commonly talked about scopes are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lexical Scope</li>\n<li>Global Scope</li>\n<li>Local Scope</li>\n<li>Execution Context</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lexical Scope</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/lexical-scoping-static-scoping\">Lexical</a> Scope refers to where a variables can be accessed within code blocks.</p>\n<h2>Global Scope</h2>\n<p><strong>Global</strong> Scope means that a variable was declared outside of a function so it can be accessed &#x26; modified throughout a program.</p>\n<h2>Local Scope</h2>\n<p>Local Scope refers the a variable that was declared within a function which means mean that it can only be accessed within that function.</p>\n<p><strong>example:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var globalVar = ‘This var is global’;\nvar myFunc = function() {\n     var localVar = ‘This var is local’;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Execution Context</h2>\n<p>Execution context is memory scope. It’s created as a program runs.</p>\n<p><strong>A fun example which demonstrates scope:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var makeArray = function() {\n    return [];\n};\nvar array1 = makeArray();\nvar array2 = makeArray();\n\nconsole.log(array1 === array2); // returns false\n// it returns false b/c array1 &#x26; array2 are 2 different array objects\n// they have 2 different execution contexts\n\nconsole.log(array1 == array2); // also, returns false\n// == still returns false because the do not refer to the same object\n// http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3 (1.f.)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Javascript Scope, like a mall, is essential. It's great walking through the mall but you're not at Walmart. You want specialized items. You can walk around the mall &#x26; hear that mall music. That's The Global Scope. You don't want to go into a Footlocker to get shoes &#x26; walk out with a taco. You don't go to Taco Bell to get the new J's but if you could for the price of a taco - that'd be cool. Where you're able to go to purchase shoes or a taco - that's Lexical Scope. Anything that you buy or other interactions that happen as you go through the mall can be remembered as the execution context.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-c12805f3431489f2744ca979d333dbeb-","value":"<p>Today, I was assigned the task of printing logs to the page instead of to the <code>console</code> if there was a certain string appended to the url so that the our Q/A engineer could get that data into his program.</p>\n<p>My task was manageable, but before committing my pull request my boss &#x26; I went over the debug program (called <code>debug.js</code>).

So, getting started with a Car Object - I'll create basic care properties &#x26; values with a method to define the properties &#x26; functions of a car.</p>\n<h2>1. Writing a basic object</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  tires: '4',\n  doors: '4',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    return speed++;\n  }\n}\nconsole.log(car);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Live <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/11d907a2ace3de3939a17e9ac3b5367f/\">code</a></p>\n<p>There's are some issues with this code. One is, what would happen if you wanted to write a new car object with different properties? Another is, what would happen to our object if some used the same variable name?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n\nvar van = {\n  color: 'blue',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n// man, we're writing a lot of code for 2 objects which are basically the same.\nconsole.log(car, van);\nvar car = 0;\nconsole.log(car);\n// &#x26; crap, now setting the variable car to 0 - we just overwrote the object.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Live <a href=\"//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/6880faa269c6a2efc627943fccdb9085\">code</a>.</p>\n<p>From the last example above, we can see that writing out all of those objects like that would be difficult. Also, we can see that we can/could just re-assign the variable which defines the object &#x26; the entire object would be re-defined.</p>\n<h2>2. Prototype Chains</h2>\n<p>After seeing a basic Javascript Object &#x26; seeing where it can fail &#x26; where it can become very repetitious we can begin to understand why more complex objects are more important.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We should always try to keep our code <a href=\"//code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-key-software-principles-you-must-understand--net-25161\">DRY</a> (not repeating).</li>\n<li>We should try to not have our code be re-writable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Prototype Chains, deal with the first issue - keep things DRY.</p>\n<h2>Generally be aware of these things while reading this post or building objects</h2>\n<p><strong>Object.create</strong> is used to copy another object</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After Object.create is used, if an object DOES NOT have a property it will go to the original object to see if that object has the property.</li>\n<li>the copied properties are inherited 1 time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>Object Prototype</strong> has various helper functions that are inherited from Object. What this means is, built into the browser, JS has methods that are automatically attached to an object when it is created.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Object Constructor</strong> is not the <em>Object Prototype</em>. An <em>Object constructor</em> is the object that the an instance of an Object was instansiated from; basically the object constructor is GOD to the an instance of an object.</p>\n<p><strong>array prototype</strong> has various helper functions &#x26; is associated with an array</p>\n<ul>\n<li>delegates to the object prototype</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n\nvar van = Object.create(car);\n\nvan.back = 'You can sleep in the back of this thing!';\nconsole.log(van.color, van.back);\n</code></pre>\n<p>View it <a href=\"//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/1665f351bf708ff50d0d797a086bfe3d\">live</a>.</p>\n<p>In the example above we create a static object and then copy it using <strong>Object.create()</strong>. That Object has access to helper functions, or methods, that are part of the Javascript Prototype. When an Object Prototype is created the instance of that creation is that Object's Object Constructor. The Object Constructor points to what instansiated that Object.</p>\n<p>That's confusing so here's an example to demonstate.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AConstructor = function(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nvar newConstructor = new AConstructor('The Constructor');\ndocument.write('newConstructor.constructor is ' + newConstructor.constructor);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Live <a href=\"//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/cd51d0d430c6dd567cd42670d4429565\">code</a>.</p>\n<p>So, in summary of Prototype Chains - they save us some time by allowing us to copy Objects &#x26; there properties but the still do not resolve the first issue - the original Object can be overwritten if it is assigned to a new value.</p>\n<h2>3. Object Decorator Pattern</h2>\n<p>The Object Decorator takes in an object &#x26; adds properties or methods to it. It's common to use adjectives (see below for reference, note the name <em>descriptive</em>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var descriptive = function(obj, num) {\n  obj.num = num;\n  obj.descriptiveCount = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  };\n  return obj;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Notice in the example above that <em>obj</em> is used where we could seemingly use the key word <em>this</em>. The reason why <em>obj</em> was used is because of the <em>execution context</em>. If <em>this</em> was used we would keep recreating the function descriptiveCount every time a new instance of the <em>descriptive</em> object.</p>\n<h2>4. Functional Classes</h2>\n<p>A simple summation of a JavaScript Class is a function that can create similar Objects.</p>\n<p>The difference between a <em>Decorator</em> &#x26; a <em>Class</em> is that a <em>Class</em> <em><strong>builds</strong></em> the Object where a <em>Decorator</em> accepts the object.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Decorator\nvar descriptive = function(obj, num) {\n  obj.descriptiveCount = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  };\n  return obj;\n}\n\n// Class\nvar AClass = function(num) {\n  // Note on the line below that the class is being created within the function\n  var obj = {num: num}\n  obj.addOne = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  }\n  return obj;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Classes are written with a Capital first letter</li>\n<li>They are written with Constructor Functions. Constructor Functions are functions that create a <em>class</em>.</li>\n<li>A Class contains all of the things that we would like to build (properties, methods)</li>\n<li>Objects that get returned from a class are <em>instances</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AClass = function(num) {\n  var obj = {num: num};\n  obj.methods = AClass.methods;\n  // Note, extends could be added here to replace the line above like:\n  // extends(obj, AClass.methods);\n  return obj;\n}\nAClass.methods = {\n  addOne : function() {\n    this.num++;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>The example above demonstrates how to add a method to a class without duplicating the method within the execution context every times a new instance is created.</li>\n<li><strong>Note</strong>: we could use extends to extend the methods of the <em>AClass (from the example above)</em> or a <em>Class</em> but this is not provided natively in JavaScript.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Prototypal Classes</h2>\n<p>Prototypal Classes can be used instead of <em>extends</em> or (from the last example above) <em>obj.methods = AClass.methods;</em> to store all methods of a <em>class</em>.</p>\n<p>Prototypal Classes, or the Prototypal Pattern are best used for sharing methods in a way that doesn't inflate the execution context.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AClass = function(num) {\n  var obj = Object.create(AClass.prototype);\n  obj.num = num;\n  return obj;\n}\nAClass.prototype.addOne = function() {\n  this.num++;\n}\n// Note: AClass.prototype.constructor (all prototypes hav a constructor property)\nvar aNewClass = AClass(1);\naNewClass.addOne();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>6. Pseudo-classical Classes</h2>\n<p>The difference between Pseudo-classical Classes &#x26; Prototypal Classes is that the <em>new</em> key word to instansiate a new object so we no longer need to return the Object or use <em>Object.create()</em>. See the example below for reference.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AClass = function(num) {\n  // var obj = Object.create(AClass.prototype);\n  this.num = num;\n  // return obj;\n  // by using the new key word below we can comment out (remove in most situations) the 2 lines of code above\n}\nAClass.prototype.addOne = function() {\n  this.num++;\n}\nvar aNewClass = new AClass(1);\naNewClass.addOne();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>7. Super-Classes &#x26; Sub-Classes</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sub-Classes</strong></em> &#x26; <em><strong>Super-Classes</strong></em> give the power for objects to share classes but be different.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">  var Car = function() {\n    var obj = {loc: loc};\n    obj.move = function() {\n      obj.loc++;\n    }\n    return obj;\n  };\n  var Van = function(loc) {\n    var obj = Car(loc);\n    obj.grab = function(){\n\n    };\n    return obj;\n  }\n  var Cop = function(loc) {\n    var obj = Car(loc);\n    obj.call = function() {\n\n    };\n    return obj;\n  }\n  var amy = Van(1);\n  amy.move();\n  var cal = Cop(2);\n  cop.call();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>8. Super-Class, Sub-Class &#x26; Pseudo Classical Sub-Classes</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">  var Car = function(loc) {\n       this.loc = loc;\n  };\n  Car.prototype.move = function() {\n       this.loc++;\n  };\n  var Van = function(loc) {\n       Car.call(this, loc);\n  };\n  Van.prototype = Object.create(Car.prototype);\n  Van.prototype.constructor = Van.constructor;\n  Van.prototype.grab = function() {};\n\n  // Calls\n  var OtherCar = new Car(6);\n  OtherCar.move();\n\n  var VarCar2 = new Van(8);\n  console.log(VanCar2.loc);\n  VarCar2.move();\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I was preparing through this post I was gathering information from various sources but was mainly following the instruction of <a href=\"//www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015\">UdaCity's JS OOP Course</a>.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-6c119e4dd455b4ceb26c7b41ab8f6268-","value":"<p>Using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">markdown</a> is a quick way to set up a <em>semi-formatted</em> post or page.

I was around 21. I'm 35 now. I threw a temper tantrum while trying to find a place to park in the magnificent mile area.\n{: .first-paragraph}</p>\n<p>After parking, I remember looking into girlfriend's big green eyes right after we got out of the car. She was looking at me so empathically. \"I'm going to dump you in a few months\" she was probably thinking. She was just waiting for right exit. It's not that I didn't have good qualities then. I was full of charisma and passion but my passion was usually about art or skateboarding and <em>I could be selfish</em> in general. However, this moment at the MCA, seeing Kentridge's work for the first time, was a moment in which my passion for art allowed me to be open to a beautiful world outside of me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I'm going to dump you in a few months\" she was probably thinking still waiting for right exit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Kentridge Exhibit was at the <a href=\"//mcachicago.org/Home\">MCA</a> during the winter. I remember the weather being cold and feeling grumpy, even after my car was parked. I drove a long way get here (I thought to myself). I am so busy and have semester finals and I don't have time for this (I thought to myself). I think that even then my hair was thinning. I can remember, or at least imagine, tufts of blond hair on top of my intense furrowed face blowing in the wind as my girlfriend and I walked up the steps to the museum—my hair and her planning their escape. My hair: \"I'm going to slowly and politely leave out the back\". My girlfriend: \"Ah, the fade away. Me too!\".</p>\n<p>We all (my hair, my girlfriend and I) entered the museum and got to the exhibit. The exhibit was a series of installation videos. Each video was a narrative done in charcoal frames.</p>\n<p>Kentridge's process for making his videos was/is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>do the drawing with charcoal on paper,</li>\n<li>manipulate the unset charcoal on that <em>same piece of paper</em> for multiple stills of the video.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result of his drawing process was that rest of the gallery space, besides the videos, were the beautiful drawings that he used for each video still. It was impressive. I loved Kentride's confidence to make drawings and then change them. It takes a rare artist to be unafraid of changing work to further communicate a narrative. This is why I found this exhibit so exciting.</p>\n<iframe style=\"height: auto; min-height: 315px; width: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmvK7A84dlk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>As I was watching Kentridge's short films which dealt with time and social issues in South Africa during that time I felt my intense heart getting soft. Kentridge's sketches did more than demonstrate a deep understanding of space technically in his drawing style but also had feeling. It seemed to me that Kentridge wanted to <em>have a point</em> more than <em>a beautiful sketch</em>. My girlfriend looked at me, I had tears welling in my eyes. This is what I remember her liking about me—my ability to be there in the moment. I could just love something. I grabbed her hand and we walked around the museum together smiling with tears in my eyes (a common scenario for me still). I felt myself being curious about the world which Kentridge had created. The empathetic narrative in his artwork extended to me wondering about my girlfriend’s reality and her feelings. I'd been selfish earlier that day, throwing tantrums and being grumpy. We'd drove down from Madison together and she was taking the same semester finals as me at the same college. I had made the drive and the trip all about me.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/things-change/william-kentridge.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing by William Kentridge: Anything Is Possible\" />\n</figure>\n<p>After getting dinner, we went back to Madison. It was business as usual, studying for finals and going to class. We didn't talk much about those moments at the MCA. In general at that time I had an amazing gift of being a light hearted center of a party type of guy until <strong>I wasn't</strong>. So we coasted until the semester was done. Those moments probably probably were in the front of both of our minds and but the furthest thing from words.</p>\n<p>My parents where diplomats and stationed in Albania at that time. When finals and the semester was over, I went and visited them in Tirana. I liked Albania. It has amazing fruit. The people were friendly to me and didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that I was <em>a character</em>.</p>\n<p>One day, while in Albania, I went with a group of hikers down by the sea. There were fisherman fishing with dynamite at the beach we were hiking on. I got a call from my girlfriend on my Nokia Cell Phone (remember: 2000/2001). \"Do you have time to talk?\", she asked. \"Of course.\", I said; dynamite explosions happening in the background. \"I've met someone; someone else\", she said, \"I don't want to be with you anymore.\". At that moment, a dynamite explosion happened. Fish and fish guts flew into the air. I could hear the fisherman boys' glee as they giggled near by. \"I understand.\", I said to my girlfriend on the phone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I don't want to be with you anymore.\". At that moment, a dynamite explosion happened. Fish and fish guts flew into the air.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We, Emily (my girlfriend of that time) and I, talked a few times after that and not about us really. The conversations were more along the lines of: \"Can I get this back?\". There was never much closure and there didn't have to be. We were very different and I'd been a selfish boyfriend for the most part. I think fondly of moments I spent with her and I smile when I think of my first time seeing William Kentridge and getting dumped to the sound of fish being blown up with dynamite in the background (not about the fish being blown up specifically - I'm not into that).</p>\n<p>Years later, I did a series of work - fully embracing that eye opening situation and the new door to life that was accessed after seeing William Kentridge’s work.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/things-change/man.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing by William Kentridge: Anything Is Possible\" />\n</figure>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-98a22c7b74e2cb17244fbf7f475634d9-","value":"<p>On Friday, I had the opportunity to go to the first LA Node.js Meetup.

Recently, I was challenged to make some sticky items that were fairly complex so I decided to write a plugin that would work for me &#x26; my use cases called <a href=\"https://github.com/yowainwright/sticky-bits\">Sticky Bits</a>.\n{: .first-paragraph}</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>*position: fixed</code> is a css rule for sticky navigation which positions <code>html elements</code> at a fixed point on the page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sticky Navigation in my purview became more relavant with an implemenation of <a href=\"http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/scrollspy/\">scrollspy</a> by bootstrap years ago. It seemed that providing users with visual queues became expected by users or by companies to provide location &#x26; extra navigation to users on webpages. <code>Triggers</code> that set a navigation's position to stick &#x26; change vary throughout many web experiences so I'm only going to focus on a few things that I've seen.</p>\n<h3>Browser sticky navigation</h3>\n<p>{: #device-fixed-position }</p>\n<p><em>Sticky navigation:</em> This is when a navigation is sticky to the top of a webpage from the start. This is typically done when setting an element to <code>position: fixed</code> &#x26; then either setting adding a <code>margin-top</code> to the next sibling element that is equal to the height of the fixed navigation or adding an <code>element</code> that wraps the sticky nav &#x26; then has a height that is set to the height of the fixed navigation.</p>\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/blades\">\n\t<img src=\"/assets/device-scrolling/dsc-fixed-nav.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky navigation\" />\n\t</a>\n</figure>\n<p><em>Static then fixed navigation:</em> This is when a navigation appears to be static &#x26; then a when a customer scrolls to where the top of the browser window meets the top of the sticky element - the element appears to snap to the top of the browser window. This is done by typically  wrapping the sticky navigation in an element that is set to the height of the navigation. Using a Javascript <code>.onscroll</code> event - the browser scroll event tracks for when <code>window.scrollY</code> is greater that the sticky navigation element's <code>.offsetTop</code>. This is typically a very expensive javascript call as it is done continually throughout the process of a customer's scroll. This is why functions like <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/2010/07/21/throttling-function-calls\">throttling</a>, <a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function\">debouncing</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame\">requestAnimationFrame</a> are often used to help.

It makes sense! Complex tasks where benefits of thoughtful HTML are just not considered. Not only that, project goals are iterative—they are grown upon and updated in steps. Questions like, <em>is the HTML valid?</em> or <em>is the HTML semantic?</em> are <em>never</em> asked. This small issue then grows on <em>a</em> webpage as new features are added and other websites follow a similar pattern.

We should not! Semantic HTML makes webpage content more legible to browsers, search engines, other developers, and is _much</em> easier to maintain. Yet, when looking at source code on <em>many</em> webpages, it is easy to find html that could be semantically improved. </p>\n<h2>Of course my HTML is valid</h2>\n<p>Beyond Semantic HTML, valid HTML is an issue! With browser advancements, checking whether html webpages validate just doesn't happen. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F\">Google Search</a> doesn't render valid html according to W3C spec.</li>\n<li>Neither does <a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252F\">Facebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Validation may not be an issue for Google and Facebook because there usership maybe be so large. However, most websites are <em>not</em> Google or Facebook. This is where the point of valid html is <em>still</em> be a very important thing to consider! 💭</p>\n<h2>Why might this rant matter? …Or are am I just screaming in the wind (again)?</h2>\n<p>Companies looking to grow their audience through webpages should always look to provide rich experiences that can be shared across the most possible platforms in the easiest way. Valid and semantic html would definitely make that easier and with less long run effort. </p>\n<h2>Writing HTML back in the day vs. now</h2>\n<p>Years ago when writing html for webpages, everything that was done had to pass the <a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/\">w3c test</a>. HTML validation tests were even looked at as a tool to find unclosed element tags and fix layout issues.

This is so that the end result of using the library on a webpage is minimal - just 1 inline style added (for the intersic ratio).</p>\n<p>Reframe.js's simplicity in both language &#x26; options is meant to make the plugin easy to understand &#x26; easy to write code to support your product's end goal.</p>\n<h2>Plugin Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>CSS (aspect ratio)</strong></p>\n<p>In this sass mixin, the default aspect ratio is 16:9 but we can override that to make the reframe a perfect ratio of the embed's original size.</p>\n<p>{% highlight sass %}</p>\n<p>@mixin reframe($el: iframe, $paddingTop: 56.25%){\npadding-top: $paddingTop;\nposition: relative;\nwidth: 100%;</p>\n<h1>{$el} {</h1>\n<pre><code>height: 100%;\nleft: 0;\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0;\nwidth: 100%;\n</code></pre>\n<p>  }\n}</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>\n<p>Wrap a selected element in a <code>div</code>.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>const frame = element // frame is the elmeent to be wrapped\nconst div = document.createElement('div');\nframe.parentNode.insertBefore(div, frame);\nframe.parentNode.removeChild(frame);\ndiv.appendChild(frame);</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Add padding to create an intrinsic ratio.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>// where the frame is the element &#x26; the div is the added wrapper element\nconst height = frame.offsetHeight;\nconst width = frame.offsetWidth;\nconst padding = height / width * 100;\ndiv.style.paddingTop = padding + '%';</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Make a plugin for jQuery or <a href=\"http://zeptojs.com/\">Zepto</a>.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>if (window.$) {\nwindow.$.fn.extend({\nreframe: function reframeFunc(cName) {\nreturn reframe(this, cName);\n}\n});\n}</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Add a check to the top of the plugin which allows us to select the element to reframe with jquery <em>or</em> plain js (Kodos to <a href=\"http://jakiestfu.com/\">Jacob Kelley</a> here).</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>let frames = typeof target === 'string' ? document.querySelectorAll(target) : target;\nif (!('length' in frames)) {\nframes = [frames];\n}</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Here's the code you write.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>reframe('selector');</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p data-height=\"380\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"Gjjbak\" data-default-tab=\"css,result\" data-user=\"yowainwright\" data-embed-version=\"2\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/Gjjbak/\">Reframe.js jQuery Demo</a> by Jeff Wainwright (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright\">@yowainwright</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n<h2>To Dos</h2>\n<p>Currently, I'm playing with the idea of removing the default padding of the ratio (56.25%) that's in the <code>css</code> because it is overwritten everytime the plugin is called.\nAlso, I think I will be adding a docs folder for using the plugin &#x26; specific use cases that might come up.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>One of the fun challenges when writing code for content is to support creativity in a controlled way.

I try to avoid the pattern (of containing elements) by placing a <code>max width</code> on individual elements within a content area.

When creating content blocks for webpages, widths are set so that the reader line length doesn't get to long. For smaller browser views, like on mobile devices, space to the left &#x26; right of content areas are set so that text doesn't extend the full width of the browser width or, worse yet - extend out of the browser so that the text can't be read. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When creating content blocks for webpages, widths are set so that the reader line length doesn't get to long.

The positives of this approach are that content width &#x26; margins can be set on one wrapper element. The negatives with this approach are - what if you have an image, or another element that you'd like to have a different width - you might set a negative margin &#x26; exaggerate the width like, <code>margin: 0 -1rem 0 1rem, width: calc(100% + 2rem);</code>. This is already bad &#x26; then what if the containing element has a <code>oveflow: hidden</code> property set. Ugh, you're going to get into crazy town &#x26; fast. </p>\n<h2>The <em>last current</em> way, setting different margins on different content elements</h2>\n<p>{% highlight sass %}\n// The last current way\np {\nmargin: 1rem 1rem 0;\n}\nimg {\nmargin: 1rem 0;\n}\n@media (min-width: 750px) {\np,\nimg {\nmargin-left: auto;\nmargin-right: auto;\n}\n}\n// set margins to the left &#x26; right of the wrapper element\n.container {\n// no margins in this example on the left, right, top &#x26; bottom\n// no max width set on this example\n}\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>In this method, a container element plays no role in setting the width of content within a viewport. Elements within a content block are contained by margins &#x26; max widths. Max widths may or may not be set on elements but this method often requires the use 2 margin rules on different viewports &#x26; setting a width or max width on larger viewports. The margins will almost always go something like be <code>1rem</code> to the <em>left</em> &#x26; <em>right</em> on small viewports but be set to <code>auto</code> on large viewports. With this approach there is almost always that in between moment where to content gets really wide or is positioning on the left of browser because the left &#x26; right margins haven't been set to <code>auto</code> yet. </p>\n<h2>The <em>current</em> current way, setting the margins once &#x26; setting elements widths as desired</h2>\n<p>{% highlight sass %}\n// The new new way\np,\nimg {\nmargin: 1rem auto 0;\nmax-width: calc(100% - 2rem);\n}\nimg {\nmargin: 1rem  auto 0;\nmax-width: 100% !important;\n}\n@media (min-width: 750px) {\np {\nmax-width: 50rem;\n}\n}\n// set margins to the left &#x26; right of the wrapper element\n.container {\n// no margins in this example on the left, right, top &#x26; bottom\n// no max width set on this example\n}\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Finally, my perferred approach is to set the margins of properties only once &#x26; resetting the preferred width of elements based on the viewport size. I do this with calc. It works great. So for a mobile view I have the width set to <code>calc(100% - 2rem)</code> which tells the browser make this element 100% of the viewport width with a margin of 1 on either side. You'll find in this approach that the content is always centered &#x26; that elements with of 100% can be centered as well.</p>\n<p>I hope you've found this post to be informative.

It's important for me to remember these categories when learning about projects so that I can optimize my time spent learning, building and tooling with JavaScript.

I find that when I break down JavaScript projects into these categories, I'm able to invest my time appropriately and pick tools faster. </p>\n<h2>The Core 4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugins 🔌</li>\n<li>Libraries 📚</li>\n<li>Frameworks 🖼</li>\n<li>Services 🔧</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Core 4 Definitions</h2>\n<p>🔌  <strong>Plugins:</strong> are a small usable functions. They should mainly do 1 thing and be usable across a wide spectrum of Frameworks, Libraries, and Services. If I can't make a plugin work within several minutes, then I move on. </p>\n<p>📚  <strong>Libraries:</strong> are groups of utilities. Examples of projects I consider libraries are <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> and <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">LoDash</a>. Libraries create ways for their users to more easily do things like manipulate html. I find I change Libraries minimally so I tend to go for rock solid products that are stable and well documented.</p>\n<p>🖼  <strong>Frameworks:</strong> are projects like <a href=\"https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/\">Angular</a>, <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/\">Ember</a>, and <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>. They establish patterns for writing entire systems of code. Frameworks are the cornerstone of products I build so when choosing a framework I build little apps and think about how that Framework's functionality will apply to the project I will be using it for. I invest a few days into understanding the basics of a Framework to make sure it's the right choice for a product.</p>\n<p>🔧  <strong>Services:</strong> are things like compilers, task runners, or bundlers (<a href=\"http://webpack.github.io/\">Webpack</a> or <a href=\"http://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>).

Other surfers didn't know what to think. They were chuckling subtly under their breath. Until she started charging waves. She didn't seem to care about the weather at all. It was inspiring. I think the whole beach was stoked!</p>\n<p>We had more rain the day after our surf adventure. This particular rain was called <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/los-angeles-storm-rain-california-2017-2\">The Storm of the Decade</a>. Quintin, Jill and I went out to surf just before the storm and realized quickly that that would have been a bad idea. We, instead, went up the coast on Highway 1 to enjoy the storm from the ocean caves around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Carrillo\">Leo Carillo</a>. It was a fantastic moment—one that I will not forget. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-6/quintin-jill.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Leo Carillo Rock and Stream at Leo Carillo State Beach in California.\" />\n</figure>\n<h2>3000 Commits on Github and 2.5k Stars</h2>\n<p>I'm thankful for my line of work and the teams I work with.  I sometimes feel like I don't fit the mold of the work that I do. Tools like Github point out—'Hey, this person gets shit done!' And I do. I will continue to release simple usable open source projects and commit at a rapid rate for the projects that I'm working on. It makes me feel good to have tools that show my value. Thanks, Github!</p>\n<h2>Building Analytics Products</h2>\n<p>Besides my own little Github atta-boy, we released an analytics update to the product that I've been working on which went smashingly well. This result is from our team's great communication on this project. I continue to find that when communication is in sync with project goals—the code needed is much easier to write. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion, I'm thankful full a lot this week</h2>\n<p>I'm very thankful that I got to meet Jill, Quintin's wife. She is definitely who I hoped for in a partner for my good friend. I'm also thankful to be able to do the work that I do. I hope over this year I'm able to write more open source plugins and tools that people find valuable and continue to be a valued contributor to my team.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-aabdcfd6e6dff4d0253f38593c976326-","value":"<p>The 5th week post is coming a week late.

These are nice features of a beach. I had never really explored the beach beyond these observations though. I did that this week. Just north of the rocks and stream that is observable from highway are a few rock caves. The whole scene—the waves, the stream and the rock cave are memorable.

To more closely mimic my team, I decided to make the switch from Sublime 3 (another text editor) to Atom.</p>\n<h2>Initial Feelings</h2>\n<p>My initial take on Atom was that beautiful—more beautiful out-of-the-box than Sublime and I liked that. I started to invest time learning quick keys. Over time, I noticed that Sublime had out of the box features that were not available with Atom—like drag-and-drop.  Avoiding dragging is important but for *<em>1 thing</em> I do a lot I couldn't find a solution and dragging seems easier for me. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>*RE: 1 thing: With an Atom Window open I could not figure out a way to drag-and-drop a new project folder into its sidebar. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Beyond that, I found Atom to be slow and a memory hog.

When she arrived in Manhattan Beach, where I lived, we became fast friends. At the time, I was recovering from a serious bout with Pneumonia. The sickness had left me a bit depressed. She was going through some life changes making us the perfect travel/hang-out duo.\n{: .first-paragraph}</p>\n<p>After meeting, we immediately discussed politics and history. Normal stuff, right? 😂 She was passionate about certain things, like Cuba. These certain things she could describe in great detail which I enjoyed listening to for hours. We enjoyed debating certain points. I learned a from her responses. </p>\n<p>She had a lot to say about several television shows, like Game of Throwns and Bob's Burgers. I know many people watch a lot of television shows—but not like Lauren. She could converse, debate and laugh about each episode of a show she watched in detail. I would watch shows just to connect the dots of the stories Lauren would tell about shows. </p>\n<p>The first trip that she roped me into was from Chicago to Orlando in the dead of winter. I don't know why she asked me to go but we went. We left Chicago in a blizzard and I remember thinking, 'This is a horrible idea! Why am I doing this?'. We stopped in Memphis and listened to blues before heading further South—to the Gulf of Mexico. </p>\n<p>I remember arrving to the Gulf of Mexico and asking if we could watch the sunset from the Gulf. We went to an old lighthouse. The water was so calm; much more calm than I ever see in the Pacific. Lauren walked to shore facing the sun as it set> She buckled her knees (as she would) and crossed her arms. She looked almost mad at first. Then she took in a deep breath and it seemed that her whole body melted in view. It was the best sunset. At that moment, I was so glad I was on that trip. After, I arriving in Orlando I assumed I wouldn't see her again. She had made plans to be a teacher abroad in Doha. </p>\n<p>A few weeks later, she reached out with a request to drive to Big Sur—a place she had wanted to go to and a favorite place of mine. She came back to California and we drove up the coast staying in Santa Barbara, Monterey, and Morro Bay. It was a memorable trip. Lauren left to teach in Doha after. </p>\n<p>Lauren and I would touch base after she moved to Doha—to reflect on our trips, what was up in our lives and reminisce a bit about fun times we'd had. She'd seemed well and that made me happy. I felt like we'd grown so much together. For myself, I'd learned how to live my life outside of who I'd been before Pneumonia. The new me was a bit more accepting of myself and I am thankful for what I learned from Lauren. I felt a stronger desire to just-enjoy-stuff and accept the people I care about for who the are ·and were. </p>\n<p>I'll never forget Lauren for that and our trips. She will live on in my mind; appreciating sunsets—accepting a landscape so much that she seems to become a part of it, like that moment at the Gulf of Mexico. She will be missed. I'll always see a bit of her in every sunset I watch—its quite good-bye mixed with fiery light. I'll miss you Lauren Schlueter. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/losing-a-friend/gulf-of-mexico.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Lauren at the Gulf of Mexico\" />\n</figure>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-de6100e9b6e60e23a919317cd943ef41-","value":"<p>Open source plugin code can become confusing. After writing a few open source plugins, I've realized that readability is very important to get help and make code better. One area where readability becomes confusing is options code. In this short post, I will go over options code in JavaScript Plugins and how it can be improved.\n{: .first-paragraph}</p>\n<h2>What are options?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Options, in JavaScript, are arguements passed in a function to replace default properties values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Options, in JavaScript, are arguements passed in a function to replace default properties values. In example, sometimes a plugin will have a default css class that it is associated with. Plugins will often allow users to change this default css class. </p>\n<p>Here an example of how options look in JavaScript from ES5:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javaScript\">function someFunction(opts) {\n  var defaults = {\n    el: document.documentElement,\n    win: window,\n    attribute: 'data-some-attr'\n  };\n  var el = opts &#x26;&#x26; opts.el || defaults.el;\n  var win = opts &#x26;&#x26; opts.win || defaults.win;\n  var attribute = opts &#x26;&#x26; opts.attribute || defaults.attribute;\n  // for exampe perposes\n  return console.log({\n    element: el,\n    document: win,\n    attr: attribute\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here's how it can be changed when it is initiated:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javaScript\">someFunction({attribute: 'data-attr'});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <em>log</em> will now looking something like: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javaScript\">  Object: attr: \"data-attr\", document: Window, element: html\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Defined Options Is Confusing</h2>\n<p>The <code>options</code> code above is confusing! I mean, what the heck is going on here?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javaScript\">var el = opts &#x26;&#x26; opts.el || defaults.el;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code needs an <code>el</code> property. It says, define the <code>el</code> property from <code>opts</code> (passed in from a function) or get the default <code>el</code> value. That's a lot of work to make sure that a property has a value.</p>\n<h2>Option Readability Can Be Improved With ES6</h2>\n<p>ES6, with function destructuring allows us to make options code more readable.</p>\n<p>With ES6, we can write this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javaScript\">function someFunction({\n  el = document.documentElement,\n  win = window,\n  attribute = 'data-some-attr' } = {}) {\n  return console.log({\n    element: el,\n    document: win,\n    attr: attribute\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then add any custom opts with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javaScript\">someFunction({attribute: 'data-attr'});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This trims down the reference to a poperty value to 2 times versus 3!</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With ES6 function destructuring, options code is much cleaner and easier to read. As a result Open Source Plugins that use this feature are easier to improve and understand.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-8f7e123d1aa658d8c395ca615bd4b42a-","value":"<p>This week had a little bit of everything for me.

Monday was bigger, so we (Jon and I) surfed at Sunset for 4 hours. I was able to get into some corners really nice. </p>\n<p>I surfed Venice on Wednesday and Thursday. Wednesday was fun with a bunch of peeler waves. Thursday, was a really interesting day. A sandbar cliff had been created on shore. Waves were going into shore, hitting the sandbar cliff, and going back out with a similar force that they had come in with and hitting another incoming wave. This whould cause the incoming wave to grow in size suddenly. What this meant for surfing was fun jumpy waves. </p>\n<p>On Saturday, I went to Ventura Point. The wave were small and fun.

Before having pneumonia I was able to do several things that I haven't been able to do after—like run several miles pretty fast. I was pretty depressed about this change and then my friend made fun of me, \"But you can still run, right?\". She was right.

The not as cool part [for right now], is the amount of different things I'm working on is almost too much to take on all at once. It's a lot for my brain to consume and comprehend when there is context switching between old progress, new team dynamics, new tools and new skills that I need to learn. In this case, 'context switching' means changing up a thought process and/or workflow a lot. </p>\n<p>As far as what I'm learning, I'm getting much more comfortable with Docker. I'm also getting a crash course in debugging. The best thing I've done so far is destroy my local dev box version needlessly a few times and disconnect my local MySQL for the content site which does not run on docker. It hasn't been the most fun but I've gained a lot from debugging and I've been able to work with more developers—very cool.</p>\n<h2>Surfing Time</h2>\n<p>Late the week before last, I was getting out of the water and over extended my leg a bit so I wasn't able to surf. This was good for focusing my time on learning my new workflow at work but still a bummer. </p>\n<p>Then the weekend came and my body was feeling pretty good. I added fins and a leash to my new fun board—a 7'2\" for small wave days.

Well, if that is the case then I'm officially an Angeleno. I went to dinner on Sunday and came back to tripping on something while getting ready to get into my car. The thing that I tripped on was my side view mirror. Upon closer inspection of my car in the darkness (it was night), my side view mirror was off and it had scratches from my front bumper, on both side doors, and my rear bumper. After going to the body shop I learned it was well over a $1k in damages. The person that ran into my car left no note so 100% of the cost was on me—or so I thought. </p>\n<p>After going to my local body shop, they informed me that I could contact my insurance without filing a claim if I stated, 'I didn't want to file a claim' when the conversation started. So I did that and found the insurance company to be very helpful. After discussing my car issue with my insurance, I found I would only have to pay the co-pay of my damages plus my insurance would not go up! </p>\n<p>All-in-all, I learned new things from side-swipe situation. It is going to cost me about $600 after it's all said and done—WAY better than what I thought.</p>\n<h2>Concluding the week</h2>\n<p>This week will go down as fair because, 'darn-it'—being injured and having my car side-swiped was not fun.

The week after, I stayed above Ojai on Highway 33. I've surfed most days over these past 3 weeks and have still maintained productivity coding.\n{: .first-paragraph}</p>\n<h2>Staying in Ojai</h2>\n<p>Highway 33 above Ojai is a beautiful road leading to several beautiful places, like <a href=\"https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/rose-valley-falls-padres/\">Rosewood Falls</a>. It runs along a few streams and goes from sea level to over 6k ft. I've cycled on it and I've now camped along it. Something that I really enjoy about it is it's difference from Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains. Where Malibu is mainly shrubbery, along Highway 33 there are several steams and as the road evalates, the landscape changes to the point that when I've been to the road's highest point—I've been above the clouds and it's been below freezing.</p>\n<p>2 weeks ago, while staying there, I made sure to park in an overnight hiking spot so I was able to camp and go with ease. I was slightly nervous because I didn't have cel service and was definitely along but that also made the trip exciting. In the morning, I was able to drive down the into Ventura to surf with ease. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-13/hwy-33.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Jetty in Playa Del Ray\" />\n</figure>\n<h2>Staying pitted (not really)</h2>\n<p>cod\nI've been lucky, I think a lot because of maintaining activity in several sports, to feel pretty healthy. Feeling healthy has allowed me to surf more. 2 weeks ago, I surfed Sunset a few times during the week and <a href=\"https://www.wannasurf.com/spot/North_America/USA/California/Ventura/Mondos/\">Mondos</a> over the weekend. I was able to get some decent rides and am showing improvements going let on waves. I'm currently work on improving my setup time to catch waves as well a getting myself into more optimal situations to catch waves at their best. </p>\n<h2>Staying productive</h2>\n<p>Switching products, learning, and maintaining projects seems like a lot and <strong>is</strong> a lot for me. I feel like I'm constantly trying to find balance between learning, building, and helping others. Helping others often helps my learn however I still bucket it separately because time involved is definitely not the same as time spent learning on my own, digging through docs and grokking code. </p>\n<p>Making the decision to travel over the weekend has taken away from time learning and working on my own projects. I'm still trying to figure out my perfect balance of time spent away from the computer and time in front of it. My goal is to enjoy days away from the computer but find time to reflect on my weekly learnings. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>2 weeks ago was good. Finding ways to camp is helping me to save money so that I can travel more. I'm still trying to balance traveling and learning. My goals is to focus on reflective learning while I travel. </p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-7db91fc5f16ed59ac12dec28916753c2-","value":"<p>This week was a humbling and emotional week for me. I feel more emotional and humbled after being sick but this week <em>the feels</em> were deeper. I'm transitioning work teams, was reminiscing about my friend Lauren who passed away, and continued learning how to surf.</p>\n<h2>Changing Teams</h2>\n<p>Changing teams is emotional for me. I put a lot into my work—all of myself for at least a full work day and usually after (by choice). Even though my teammates are usually still around I miss the experience of them working how we were. I grow attached to the ways that I was working. It's hard. Besides my working with my last team, there's always a learning curve with a new team and I feel unsure of myself because there I know there are a lot of things that I don't know. </p>\n<h2>Getting Back to Surfing</h2>\n<p>Being sick for a week and a half, I wasn't able to surf. I missed being in the water. I also want to improve. I still have a long ways to go to get to where I'd like to be surfing so time off is hard. </p>\n<p>I was able to get back in the water on Friday the 10th. I went to Venice and dropped in on a few smaller waves which is the main thing that I'm working on currently. </p>\n<p>I want to be able to drop in on waves better. I've been afraid of this part of surfing b/c I often eat shit when I try and swallow a bunch of water as well. It's not fun and swallowing a lot of water can lead to getting sick. </p>\n<p>On Saturday the 11th, I went to surf El Porto with my friend Justin but decided because of crowds that I would try a different spot. I went to Sunset and found that there were hardly any surfings and a bunch of 1-2ft waves—great for dropping in. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-9/wave-rocks-3.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Waves at Sunset on a foggy day\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Sunday, the 12th, I surfed Venice. There were 1-4ft waves. They were a bit bigger than Sunset the day before which allowed me to test my drop-in training. I dropped in on what I think may have been a 3ft wave—probably my biggest drop-in. I dropped in on several more waves and swallowed water several times. I found myself wanting to push myself which I had not felt surfing yet but I'm embracing it. </p>\n<h2>Feeling Beta</h2>\n<p>A feeling that I was thinking through this week a lot was that of feeling beta. When I write <em>feeling beta</em> I mean <em>feeling like I'm placing second in a lot of people's minds</em>. </p>\n<p>I was feeling beta because I was not feeling 100% and because there was language that was communicated to me this week that made me feel <em>less than</em> the person that was communicating to me. </p>\n<p>I actually, within myself, like the feeling of <em>being beta</em> once in a while. It tells me that my ego is motivated to improve. I'm looking forward improving in some places that I would like to. Also, the things that made me feel this way communicate to me that last week and future weeks will be a time of silent growth. </p>\n<p>It was a great week! I feel like I have a lot to look forward to over the next weeks. I have some things that I'm excited about learning and doing. </p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-8a192aa605e7873168647b27c971e07d-","value":"<p>Last week, our cadence on the analytics project grew a lot.

After Garret and I moved out, I stopped surfing before I had really started. Fast forward a few years, I met my friend and co-worker <a href=\"http://justinintime.com/\">Justin Berg</a>. We started meeting before work and surfing. Before I knew it, I was going surfing as much as I could. </p>\n<p>As of now, I've been surfing a lot since last September. It challenges and gives me satisfaction. I find even on the days I struggle catching waves or get into a wave just right, I'm given the opportunity to get frustrated in the ocean by myself—and I <em>usually</em> get a better work out. 🙃 Then, some days, I feel something new 'click' and my mind is opened to something new I enjoy about surfing. This past weekend, turning left started to 'click' for me. It felt exhilarating and empowering to be able to consider going either way on a wave (left or right).</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-14/carlsbad-1.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Jetty in Playa Del Ray\" />\n</figure>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-9851a24bd23ba22d031e53917213cb66-","value":"<p>This past week has been a tough week for some people I'm close to.

I feel more emotional and humbled after being sick but this week <em>the feels</em> were deeper. I'm transitioning work teams, was reminiscing about my friend Lauren who passed away, and continued learning how to surf.</p>\n<h2>Changing Teams</h2>\n<p>Changing teams is emotional for me. I put a lot into my work—all of myself for at least a full work day and usually after (by choice). Even though my teammates are usually still around I miss the experience of them working how we were. I grow attached to the ways that I was working. It's hard. Besides my working with my last team, there's always a learning curve with a new team and I feel unsure of myself because there I know there are a lot of things that I don't know. </p>\n<h2>Getting Back to Surfing</h2>\n<p>Being sick for a week and a half, I wasn't able to surf. I missed being in the water. I also want to improve. I still have a long ways to go to get to where I'd like to be surfing so time off is hard. </p>\n<p>I was able to get back in the water on Friday the 10th. I went to Venice and dropped in on a few smaller waves which is the main thing that I'm working on currently. </p>\n<p>I want to be able to drop in on waves better. I've been afraid of this part of surfing b/c I often eat shit when I try and swallow a bunch of water as well. It's not fun and swallowing a lot of water can lead to getting sick. </p>\n<p>On Saturday the 11th, I went to surf El Porto with my friend Justin but decided because of crowds that I would try a different spot. I went to Sunset and found that there were hardly any surfings and a bunch of 1-2ft waves—great for dropping in. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-9/wave-rocks-3.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Waves at Sunset on a foggy day\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Sunday, the 12th, I surfed Venice. There were 1-4ft waves. They were a bit bigger than Sunset the day before which allowed me to test my drop-in training. I dropped in on what I think may have been a 3ft wave—probably my biggest drop-in. I dropped in on several more waves and swallowed water several times. I found myself wanting to push myself which I had not felt surfing yet but I'm embracing it. </p>\n<h2>Feeling Beta</h2>\n<p>A feeling that I was thinking through this week a lot was that of feeling beta. When I write <em>feeling beta</em> I mean <em>feeling like I'm placing second in a lot of people's minds</em>. </p>\n<p>I was feeling beta because I was not feeling 100% and because there was language that was communicated to me this week that made me feel <em>less than</em> the person that was communicating to me. </p>\n<p>I actually, within myself, like the feeling of <em>being beta</em> once in a while. It tells me that my ego is motivated to improve. I'm looking forward improving in some places that I would like to. Also, the things that made me feel this way communicate to me that last week and future weeks will be a time of silent growth. </p>\n<p>It was a great week! I feel like I have a lot to look forward to over the next weeks. I have some things that I'm excited about learning and doing. </p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-8bdc9a6b5b05a6328acee7601ee8cc04-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Week 8, 2017—Losing a few friends, being sick, transitioning and writing some\n  code\ndate: \"2017-03-05\"\nlayout: post\nreadNext: \"/\"\npath: \"/week-8-17/\"\nmeta: Week 8, 2017—This week I was sick, lost a few friends and started to do some\n  transitioning.\nfeatured_image: \"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-7/running.jpg\"\ncategories:\n- note\n- story","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":14,"column":4,"offset":358},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Week 8 was great for sitting.

After, I arriving in Orlando I assumed I wouldn't see her again. She had made plans to be a teacher abroad in Doha. </p>\n<p>A few weeks later, she reached out with a request to drive to Big Sur—a place she had wanted to go to and a favorite place of mine. She came back to California and we drove up the coast staying in Santa Barbara, Monterey, and Morro Bay. It was a memorable trip. Lauren left to teach in Doha after. </p>\n<p>Lauren and I would touch base after she moved to Doha—to reflect on our trips, what was up in our lives and reminisce a bit about fun times we'd had. She'd seemed well and that made me happy. I felt like we'd grown so much together. For myself, I'd learned how to live my life outside of who I'd been before Pneumonia. The new me was a bit more accepting of myself and I am thankful for what I learned from Lauren. I felt a stronger desire to just-enjoy-stuff and accept the people I care about for who the are ·and were. </p>\n<p>I'll never forget Lauren for that and our trips. She will live on in my mind; appreciating sunsets—accepting a landscape so much that she seems to become a part of it, like that moment at the Gulf of Mexico. She will be missed. I'll always see a bit of her in every sunset I watch—its quite good-bye mixed with fiery light. I'll miss you Lauren Schlueter. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/losing-a-friend/gulf-of-mexico.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Lauren at the Gulf of Mexico\" />\n</figure>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-f7daa64a1aeb6288786d338fffe9447e-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Week 7, 2017—Transitioning and Climbing to Higher Heights and Deeper Turns\ndate: \"2017-02-26\"\nlayout: post\nreadNext: \"/\"\npath: \"/week-7-17/\"\nmeta: Week 7, 2017—This week I'm beginning to climbing more consistently and catch\n  waves more consistently.\nshow_image: true\nimgix: true\nfeatured_image: \"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-7/hands-up.jpg\"\ncategories:\n- note\n- story","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":15,"column":4,"offset":388},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"This week had a little bit of everything for me.

I hope over this year I'm able to write more open source plugins and tools that people find valuable and continue to be a valued contributor to my team.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-d56a09af642dc043f87b619714f5464d-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Week 5, 2017—Analytics Tech and Viewing Ocean Caves\ndate: \"2017-02-15\"\nlayout: post\nreadNext: \"/\"\npath: \"/week-5-17/\"\nmeta: Week 5, 2017—I was able to work on analytics for a current project and see Ocean\n  Caves at Leo Carillo State Beach.\nshow_image: true\nimgix: true\nfeatured_image: \"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-5/leo-carillo-rock.jpg\"\ncategories:\n- note\n- story","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":15,"column":4,"offset":386},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The 5th week post is coming a week late.

To more closely mimic my team, I decided to make the switch from Sublime 3 (another text editor) to Atom.</p>\n<h2>Initial Feelings</h2>\n<p>My initial take on Atom was that beautiful—more beautiful out-of-the-box than Sublime and I liked that. I started to invest time learning quick keys. Over time, I noticed that Sublime had out of the box features that were not available with Atom—like drag-and-drop.  Avoiding dragging is important but for *<em>1 thing</em> I do a lot I couldn't find a solution and dragging seems easier for me. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>*RE: 1 thing: With an Atom Window open I could not figure out a way to drag-and-drop a new project folder into its sidebar. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Beyond that, I found Atom to be slow and a memory hog. I've heard the debate that Sublime can become slow when a lot of plugins are added but I've never seen or felt that. </p>\n<h2>I am more productive with Sublime</h2>\n<p>After a few months of feeling like I wasn't as productive with Atom, I decided to switch back to Sublime. I started re-learning my quick keys and then looking into some of the features that I liked about Atom—to see if I could add them with a plugin in Sublime.</p>\n<h2>Making Sublime as beauitful as Atom</h2>\n<p>I love Atom's out of the box beauty. I've found that it only takes a few minutes to get Sublime to take on the features I enjoy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>File Icons: I doubt that file icons came with Atom but that's were I first saw them. With the plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/ihodev/a-file-icon\">a-file-icon</a> I was able to achieve that. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new app icon: even though I personally didn't mind the Sublime icons there are some out there that just great.

You expect a mall to have stores for shoes, stores for electronics &#x26; potentially restaurants for food after you've become hungry from going to a bunch of stores.</p>\n<p>Javascript scope can be viewed like a mall. We could say that the mall is <em>global</em> or that it is the <em>global scope</em> which means that you can access all that the mall has to offer. However, people, or me at least, don't go to a mall for to walk around in it's large amount of space, we go for stores with specific it's at specialized stores.</p>\n<p>We can consider these specialized stores the <em>local scope</em> which means that when we go to 'a shoe store' we have access to shoes there but not food &#x26; when we go to a restaurant, we have access to food but not shoes.</p>\n<p>When we go into that shoe store, we're still at the mall &#x26; can get certain information from the mall - like that awesome mall music but we also have access to shoes (but not food). This idea is known as <em>Lexical Scope</em>. So Lexical Scope deals with where information can be accessed.</p>\n<p>As we go around to these stores &#x26; purchase things, eating food &#x26; interacting with people at the mall while listening to that awesome mall music we're attaining 'stuff'. We're getting information from the music, perhaps purchasing goods from the store. We can think of that as the <em>Execution Context</em>. Execution Context is essentially, all of the stuff that we comes with &#x26; happens to us as we go there the mall. We keep the items that buy but, hopefully, forget some of the music that we listen to.</p>\n<h2>Now, Scope, seriously</h2>\n<p>To understand <strong>scope</strong>, we need to know about variables &#x26; how we store information. <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var\">Variables</a></strong> store bits of information in the key words <em>var</em>, <em><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let\">let</a></strong></em>, or <em><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const\">const</a></strong></em>. Const store a read only bit of information which means the information can’t be re-assigned. I will not be discussing <em>const</em> anymore right now so forget I brought it up. <em>Let</em> is very similar to <em>var</em> to the point that I had to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/let-keyword-vs-var-keyword\">find</a> the difference: var is scoped to the nearest function scope which let is enclosed to the nearest closing block.</p>\n<p>Scope, in Javascript, refers to where stored information can be accessed.</p>\n<p><strong>4 commonly talked about scopes are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lexical Scope</li>\n<li>Global Scope</li>\n<li>Local Scope</li>\n<li>Execution Context</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lexical Scope</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/lexical-scoping-static-scoping\">Lexical</a> Scope refers to where a variables can be accessed within code blocks.</p>\n<h2>Global Scope</h2>\n<p><strong>Global</strong> Scope means that a variable was declared outside of a function so it can be accessed &#x26; modified throughout a program.</p>\n<h2>Local Scope</h2>\n<p>Local Scope refers the a variable that was declared within a function which means mean that it can only be accessed within that function.</p>\n<p><strong>example:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var globalVar = ‘This var is global’;\nvar myFunc = function() {\n     var localVar = ‘This var is local’;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Execution Context</h2>\n<p>Execution context is memory scope.

But, understanding why they’re so important quickly become pretty complex.</p>\n<h2>JavaScript Closure by Example</h2>\n<p>The first thing that comes to mind when I try to think of an example to explain Javascript Closures is the process of microwaving. When we put something, food preferably, in a microwave, we're expecting something tasty to come out after a few minutes. Well, maybe not tasty but definitely different.</p>\n<p>We can think of a Javascript Closure like a microwave. There's an outer function, a chunk of re-usable code, which is represented by a microwave &#x26; an inner function which we could think of as the 'thingy' that cooks the food. </p>\n<p>We don't want whatever is cooking that food, to cook us, so we put the food in the microwave (outer function) &#x26; then the actual 'thingy' that cooks the food (inner function). That encapsulated process that cooks the food is what &#x26; why we use a function.</p>\n<p>Closures are important because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can create private variables</li>\n<li>They have access to functions &#x26; variables of a higher scope</li>\n<li>They’re useful with time interval functions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gettin' more serious about Closures</h2>\n<p>Javascript Closure is created when an inner function is made accessible from outside of it’s parent function. This is commonly done by returning the inner function. So like when you put food into the microwave &#x26; then get it out.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// What are Closures?\nvar closureFunction = 'Closer are functions ';\nvar rememberWhat = 'that remember ';\nvar theirEnvironment = 'the environment there were created in.

So, getting started with a Car Object - I'll create basic care properties &#x26; values with a method to define the properties &#x26; functions of a car.</p>\n<h2>1. Writing a basic object</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  tires: '4',\n  doors: '4',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    return speed++;\n  }\n}\nconsole.log(car);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Live <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/11d907a2ace3de3939a17e9ac3b5367f/\">code</a></p>\n<p>There's are some issues with this code. One is, what would happen if you wanted to write a new car object with different properties? Another is, what would happen to our object if some used the same variable name?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n\nvar van = {\n  color: 'blue',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n// man, we're writing a lot of code for 2 objects which are basically the same.\nconsole.log(car, van);\nvar car = 0;\nconsole.log(car);\n// &#x26; crap, now setting the variable car to 0 - we just overwrote the object.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Live <a href=\"//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/6880faa269c6a2efc627943fccdb9085\">code</a>.</p>\n<p>From the last example above, we can see that writing out all of those objects like that would be difficult. Also, we can see that we can/could just re-assign the variable which defines the object &#x26; the entire object would be re-defined.</p>\n<h2>2. Prototype Chains</h2>\n<p>After seeing a basic Javascript Object &#x26; seeing where it can fail &#x26; where it can become very repetitious we can begin to understand why more complex objects are more important.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We should always try to keep our code <a href=\"//code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-key-software-principles-you-must-understand--net-25161\">DRY</a> (not repeating).</li>\n<li>We should try to not have our code be re-writable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Prototype Chains, deal with the first issue - keep things DRY.</p>\n<h2>Generally be aware of these things while reading this post or building objects</h2>\n<p><strong>Object.create</strong> is used to copy another object</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After Object.create is used, if an object DOES NOT have a property it will go to the original object to see if that object has the property.</li>\n<li>the copied properties are inherited 1 time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>Object Prototype</strong> has various helper functions that are inherited from Object. What this means is, built into the browser, JS has methods that are automatically attached to an object when it is created.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Object Constructor</strong> is not the <em>Object Prototype</em>. An <em>Object constructor</em> is the object that the an instance of an Object was instansiated from; basically the object constructor is GOD to the an instance of an object.</p>\n<p><strong>array prototype</strong> has various helper functions &#x26; is associated with an array</p>\n<ul>\n<li>delegates to the object prototype</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n\nvar van = Object.create(car);\n\nvan.back = 'You can sleep in the back of this thing!';\nconsole.log(van.color, van.back);\n</code></pre>\n<p>View it <a href=\"//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/1665f351bf708ff50d0d797a086bfe3d\">live</a>.</p>\n<p>In the example above we create a static object and then copy it using <strong>Object.create()</strong>. That Object has access to helper functions, or methods, that are part of the Javascript Prototype. When an Object Prototype is created the instance of that creation is that Object's Object Constructor. The Object Constructor points to what instansiated that Object.</p>\n<p>That's confusing so here's an example to demonstate.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AConstructor = function(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nvar newConstructor = new AConstructor('The Constructor');\ndocument.write('newConstructor.constructor is ' + newConstructor.constructor);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Live <a href=\"//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/cd51d0d430c6dd567cd42670d4429565\">code</a>.</p>\n<p>So, in summary of Prototype Chains - they save us some time by allowing us to copy Objects &#x26; there properties but the still do not resolve the first issue - the original Object can be overwritten if it is assigned to a new value.</p>\n<h2>3. Object Decorator Pattern</h2>\n<p>The Object Decorator takes in an object &#x26; adds properties or methods to it. It's common to use adjectives (see below for reference, note the name <em>descriptive</em>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var descriptive = function(obj, num) {\n  obj.num = num;\n  obj.descriptiveCount = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  };\n  return obj;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Notice in the example above that <em>obj</em> is used where we could seemingly use the key word <em>this</em>. The reason why <em>obj</em> was used is because of the <em>execution context</em>. If <em>this</em> was used we would keep recreating the function descriptiveCount every time a new instance of the <em>descriptive</em> object.</p>\n<h2>4. Functional Classes</h2>\n<p>A simple summation of a JavaScript Class is a function that can create similar Objects.</p>\n<p>The difference between a <em>Decorator</em> &#x26; a <em>Class</em> is that a <em>Class</em> <em><strong>builds</strong></em> the Object where a <em>Decorator</em> accepts the object.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Decorator\nvar descriptive = function(obj, num) {\n  obj.descriptiveCount = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  };\n  return obj;\n}\n\n// Class\nvar AClass = function(num) {\n  // Note on the line below that the class is being created within the function\n  var obj = {num: num}\n  obj.addOne = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  }\n  return obj;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Classes are written with a Capital first letter</li>\n<li>They are written with Constructor Functions. Constructor Functions are functions that create a <em>class</em>.</li>\n<li>A Class contains all of the things that we would like to build (properties, methods)</li>\n<li>Objects that get returned from a class are <em>instances</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AClass = function(num) {\n  var obj = {num: num};\n  obj.methods = AClass.methods;\n  // Note, extends could be added here to replace the line above like:\n  // extends(obj, AClass.methods);\n  return obj;\n}\nAClass.methods = {\n  addOne : function() {\n    this.num++;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>The example above demonstrates how to add a method to a class without duplicating the method within the execution context every times a new instance is created.</li>\n<li><strong>Note</strong>: we could use extends to extend the methods of the <em>AClass (from the example above)</em> or a <em>Class</em> but this is not provided natively in JavaScript.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Prototypal Classes</h2>\n<p>Prototypal Classes can be used instead of <em>extends</em> or (from the last example above) <em>obj.methods = AClass.methods;</em> to store all methods of a <em>class</em>.</p>\n<p>Prototypal Classes, or the Prototypal Pattern are best used for sharing methods in a way that doesn't inflate the execution context.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AClass = function(num) {\n  var obj = Object.create(AClass.prototype);\n  obj.num = num;\n  return obj;\n}\nAClass.prototype.addOne = function() {\n  this.num++;\n}\n// Note: AClass.prototype.constructor (all prototypes hav a constructor property)\nvar aNewClass = AClass(1);\naNewClass.addOne();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>6. Pseudo-classical Classes</h2>\n<p>The difference between Pseudo-classical Classes &#x26; Prototypal Classes is that the <em>new</em> key word to instansiate a new object so we no longer need to return the Object or use <em>Object.create()</em>. See the example below for reference.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AClass = function(num) {\n  // var obj = Object.create(AClass.prototype);\n  this.num = num;\n  // return obj;\n  // by using the new key word below we can comment out (remove in most situations) the 2 lines of code above\n}\nAClass.prototype.addOne = function() {\n  this.num++;\n}\nvar aNewClass = new AClass(1);\naNewClass.addOne();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>7. Super-Classes &#x26; Sub-Classes</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sub-Classes</strong></em> &#x26; <em><strong>Super-Classes</strong></em> give the power for objects to share classes but be different.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">  var Car = function() {\n    var obj = {loc: loc};\n    obj.move = function() {\n      obj.loc++;\n    }\n    return obj;\n  };\n  var Van = function(loc) {\n    var obj = Car(loc);\n    obj.grab = function(){\n\n    };\n    return obj;\n  }\n  var Cop = function(loc) {\n    var obj = Car(loc);\n    obj.call = function() {\n\n    };\n    return obj;\n  }\n  var amy = Van(1);\n  amy.move();\n  var cal = Cop(2);\n  cop.call();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>8. Super-Class, Sub-Class &#x26; Pseudo Classical Sub-Classes</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">  var Car = function(loc) {\n       this.loc = loc;\n  };\n  Car.prototype.move = function() {\n       this.loc++;\n  };\n  var Van = function(loc) {\n       Car.call(this, loc);\n  };\n  Van.prototype = Object.create(Car.prototype);\n  Van.prototype.constructor = Van.constructor;\n  Van.prototype.grab = function() {};\n\n  // Calls\n  var OtherCar = new Car(6);\n  OtherCar.move();\n\n  var VarCar2 = new Van(8);\n  console.log(VanCar2.loc);\n  VarCar2.move();\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I was preparing through this post I was gathering information from various sources but was mainly following the instruction of <a href=\"//www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015\">UdaCity's JS OOP Course</a>.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-b90e016db3c54f48b50aa17e2ab8399b-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Understanding Javascript Objects -

So, getting started with a Car Object - I'll create basic care properties &#x26; values with a method to define the properties &#x26; functions of a car.</p>\n<h2>1. Writing a basic object</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  tires: '4',\n  doors: '4',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    return speed++;\n  }\n}\nconsole.log(car);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Live <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/11d907a2ace3de3939a17e9ac3b5367f/\">code</a></p>\n<p>There's are some issues with this code. One is, what would happen if you wanted to write a new car object with different properties? Another is, what would happen to our object if some used the same variable name?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n\nvar van = {\n  color: 'blue',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n// man, we're writing a lot of code for 2 objects which are basically the same.\nconsole.log(car, van);\nvar car = 0;\nconsole.log(car);\n// &#x26; crap, now setting the variable car to 0 - we just overwrote the object.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Live <a href=\"//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/6880faa269c6a2efc627943fccdb9085\">code</a>.</p>\n<p>From the last example above, we can see that writing out all of those objects like that would be difficult. Also, we can see that we can/could just re-assign the variable which defines the object &#x26; the entire object would be re-defined.</p>\n<h2>2. Prototype Chains</h2>\n<p>After seeing a basic Javascript Object &#x26; seeing where it can fail &#x26; where it can become very repetitious we can begin to understand why more complex objects are more important.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We should always try to keep our code <a href=\"//code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-key-software-principles-you-must-understand--net-25161\">DRY</a> (not repeating).</li>\n<li>We should try to not have our code be re-writable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Prototype Chains, deal with the first issue - keep things DRY.</p>\n<h2>Generally be aware of these things while reading this post or building objects</h2>\n<p><strong>Object.create</strong> is used to copy another object</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After Object.create is used, if an object DOES NOT have a property it will go to the original object to see if that object has the property.</li>\n<li>the copied properties are inherited 1 time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>Object Prototype</strong> has various helper functions that are inherited from Object. What this means is, built into the browser, JS has methods that are automatically attached to an object when it is created.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Object Constructor</strong> is not the <em>Object Prototype</em>. An <em>Object constructor</em> is the object that the an instance of an Object was instansiated from; basically the object constructor is GOD to the an instance of an object.</p>\n<p><strong>array prototype</strong> has various helper functions &#x26; is associated with an array</p>\n<ul>\n<li>delegates to the object prototype</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var car = {\n  color: 'white',\n  increaseSpeed: function(speed) {\n    var newSpeed = speed + 1;\n    return newSpeed;\n  }\n}\n\nvar van = Object.create(car);\n\nvan.back = 'You can sleep in the back of this thing!';\nconsole.log(van.color, van.back);\n</code></pre>\n<p>View it <a href=\"//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/1665f351bf708ff50d0d797a086bfe3d\">live</a>.</p>\n<p>In the example above we create a static object and then copy it using <strong>Object.create()</strong>. That Object has access to helper functions, or methods, that are part of the Javascript Prototype. When an Object Prototype is created the instance of that creation is that Object's Object Constructor. The Object Constructor points to what instansiated that Object.</p>\n<p>That's confusing so here's an example to demonstate.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AConstructor = function(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nvar newConstructor = new AConstructor('The Constructor');\ndocument.write('newConstructor.constructor is ' + newConstructor.constructor);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Live <a href=\"//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/cd51d0d430c6dd567cd42670d4429565\">code</a>.</p>\n<p>So, in summary of Prototype Chains - they save us some time by allowing us to copy Objects &#x26; there properties but the still do not resolve the first issue - the original Object can be overwritten if it is assigned to a new value.</p>\n<h2>3. Object Decorator Pattern</h2>\n<p>The Object Decorator takes in an object &#x26; adds properties or methods to it. It's common to use adjectives (see below for reference, note the name <em>descriptive</em>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var descriptive = function(obj, num) {\n  obj.num = num;\n  obj.descriptiveCount = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  };\n  return obj;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Notice in the example above that <em>obj</em> is used where we could seemingly use the key word <em>this</em>. The reason why <em>obj</em> was used is because of the <em>execution context</em>. If <em>this</em> was used we would keep recreating the function descriptiveCount every time a new instance of the <em>descriptive</em> object.</p>\n<h2>4. Functional Classes</h2>\n<p>A simple summation of a JavaScript Class is a function that can create similar Objects.</p>\n<p>The difference between a <em>Decorator</em> &#x26; a <em>Class</em> is that a <em>Class</em> <em><strong>builds</strong></em> the Object where a <em>Decorator</em> accepts the object.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Decorator\nvar descriptive = function(obj, num) {\n  obj.descriptiveCount = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  };\n  return obj;\n}\n\n// Class\nvar AClass = function(num) {\n  // Note on the line below that the class is being created within the function\n  var obj = {num: num}\n  obj.addOne = function() {\n    obj.num++;\n  }\n  return obj;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Classes are written with a Capital first letter</li>\n<li>They are written with Constructor Functions. Constructor Functions are functions that create a <em>class</em>.</li>\n<li>A Class contains all of the things that we would like to build (properties, methods)</li>\n<li>Objects that get returned from a class are <em>instances</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AClass = function(num) {\n  var obj = {num: num};\n  obj.methods = AClass.methods;\n  // Note, extends could be added here to replace the line above like:\n  // extends(obj, AClass.methods);\n  return obj;\n}\nAClass.methods = {\n  addOne : function() {\n    this.num++;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>The example above demonstrates how to add a method to a class without duplicating the method within the execution context every times a new instance is created.</li>\n<li><strong>Note</strong>: we could use extends to extend the methods of the <em>AClass (from the example above)</em> or a <em>Class</em> but this is not provided natively in JavaScript.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Prototypal Classes</h2>\n<p>Prototypal Classes can be used instead of <em>extends</em> or (from the last example above) <em>obj.methods = AClass.methods;</em> to store all methods of a <em>class</em>.</p>\n<p>Prototypal Classes, or the Prototypal Pattern are best used for sharing methods in a way that doesn't inflate the execution context.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AClass = function(num) {\n  var obj = Object.create(AClass.prototype);\n  obj.num = num;\n  return obj;\n}\nAClass.prototype.addOne = function() {\n  this.num++;\n}\n// Note: AClass.prototype.constructor (all prototypes hav a constructor property)\nvar aNewClass = AClass(1);\naNewClass.addOne();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>6. Pseudo-classical Classes</h2>\n<p>The difference between Pseudo-classical Classes &#x26; Prototypal Classes is that the <em>new</em> key word to instansiate a new object so we no longer need to return the Object or use <em>Object.create()</em>. See the example below for reference.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var AClass = function(num) {\n  // var obj = Object.create(AClass.prototype);\n  this.num = num;\n  // return obj;\n  // by using the new key word below we can comment out (remove in most situations) the 2 lines of code above\n}\nAClass.prototype.addOne = function() {\n  this.num++;\n}\nvar aNewClass = new AClass(1);\naNewClass.addOne();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>7. Super-Classes &#x26; Sub-Classes</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sub-Classes</strong></em> &#x26; <em><strong>Super-Classes</strong></em> give the power for objects to share classes but be different.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">  var Car = function() {\n    var obj = {loc: loc};\n    obj.move = function() {\n      obj.loc++;\n    }\n    return obj;\n  };\n  var Van = function(loc) {\n    var obj = Car(loc);\n    obj.grab = function(){\n\n    };\n    return obj;\n  }\n  var Cop = function(loc) {\n    var obj = Car(loc);\n    obj.call = function() {\n\n    };\n    return obj;\n  }\n  var amy = Van(1);\n  amy.move();\n  var cal = Cop(2);\n  cop.call();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>8. Super-Class, Sub-Class &#x26; Pseudo Classical Sub-Classes</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">  var Car = function(loc) {\n       this.loc = loc;\n  };\n  Car.prototype.move = function() {\n       this.loc++;\n  };\n  var Van = function(loc) {\n       Car.call(this, loc);\n  };\n  Van.prototype = Object.create(Car.prototype);\n  Van.prototype.constructor = Van.constructor;\n  Van.prototype.grab = function() {};\n\n  // Calls\n  var OtherCar = new Car(6);\n  OtherCar.move();\n\n  var VarCar2 = new Van(8);\n  console.log(VanCar2.loc);\n  VarCar2.move();\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I was preparing through this post I was gathering information from various sources but was mainly following the instruction of <a href=\"//www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015\">UdaCity's JS OOP Course</a>.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-24c43ad92ce851f02d4884ca44d4cea9-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Javascript's keyword this; THIS is what I'm talking about!\ndate: \"2015-01-10\"\nlayout: post\nreadNext: \"/\"\npath: \"/js-keyword-this/\"\nmeta: This post goes into Javascript's keyword this, how it is defined & why it is\n  misunderstood\nshare_image: \"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/icons/js.jpg\"\ncategories:\n- javascript\n- code","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":13,"column":4,"offset":335},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The ","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1,"offset":337},"end":{"line":15,"column":5,"offset":341},"indent":[]}},{"type":"emphasis","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"this","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":8,"offset":344},"end":{"line":15,"column":12,"offset":348},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":6,"offset":342},"end":{"line":15,"column":14,"offset":350},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":5,"offset":341},"end":{"line":15,"column":15,"offset":351},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" keyword in Javascript is something that has often confused me, especial which object it is attached to.

Using a Javascript <code>.onscroll</code> event - the browser scroll event tracks for when <code>window.scrollY</code> is greater that the sticky navigation element's <code>.offsetTop</code>. This is typically a very expensive javascript call as it is done continually throughout the process of a customer's scroll.

The margins will almost always go something like be <code>1rem</code> to the <em>left</em> &#x26; <em>right</em> on small viewports but be set to <code>auto</code> on large viewports.

With this approach there is almost always that in between moment where to content gets really wide or is positioning on the left of browser because the left &#x26; right margins haven't been set to <code>auto</code> yet. </p>\n<h2>The <em>current</em> current way, setting the margins once &#x26; setting elements widths as desired</h2>\n<p>{% highlight sass %}\n// The new new way\np,\nimg {\nmargin: 1rem auto 0;\nmax-width: calc(100% - 2rem);\n}\nimg {\nmargin: 1rem  auto 0;\nmax-width: 100% !important;\n}\n@media (min-width: 750px) {\np {\nmax-width: 50rem;\n}\n}\n// set margins to the left &#x26; right of the wrapper element\n.container {\n// no margins in this example on the left, right, top &#x26; bottom\n// no max width set on this example\n}\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Finally, my perferred approach is to set the margins of properties only once &#x26; resetting the preferred width of elements based on the viewport size. I do this with calc. It works great. So for a mobile view I have the width set to <code>calc(100% - 2rem)</code> which tells the browser make this element 100% of the viewport width with a margin of 1 on either side. You'll find in this approach that the content is always centered &#x26; that elements with of 100% can be centered as well.</p>\n<p>I hope you've found this post to be informative.

FitVids is a great plugin for solving reframing videos. It's written by 2 of my idols, <a href=\"http://chriscoyier.net/\">Chris Coyier</a> &#x26; <a href=\"http://daverupert.com/\">Dave Ruppert</a>. Fitvids <em>takes a chance</em> that most of your content will be 1 of 5 <code>selectors</code>. If those assumptions are correct (&#x26; if you're using jQuery) - FitVids is golden. If not, there might need to be little extra code on top of the little extra code added that assumes your embedded content will be 1 of 5 <code>selectors</code>. The reason that Reframe.js was originally made was because <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> was not being used on a new product at <a href=\"http://dollarshaveclub.com\">DSC</a>.</p>\n<p>Reframe.js also:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>doesn't assume your reframing just videos (by name at least),</li>\n<li>offers a css mixin rather than inlining css which can make your dom (html) cleaner</li>\n<li>&#x26; offers jQuery plugin that is written in such a way that if unused - it can be shaken out with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/tree-shaking-versus-dead-code-elimination-d3765df85c80#.ccnp22e5f\">Tree shaking</a>.\nThese things make the code lighter initially.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Options</h2>\n<p>The one option supported by Reframe.js is the ability to add your own css class instead of the default css class <code>js-reframe</code>. This is so that the end result of using the library on a webpage is minimal - just 1 inline style added (for the intersic ratio).</p>\n<p>Reframe.js's simplicity in both language &#x26; options is meant to make the plugin easy to understand &#x26; easy to write code to support your product's end goal.</p>\n<h2>Plugin Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>CSS (aspect ratio)</strong></p>\n<p>In this sass mixin, the default aspect ratio is 16:9 but we can override that to make the reframe a perfect ratio of the embed's original size.</p>\n<p>{% highlight sass %}</p>\n<p>@mixin reframe($el: iframe, $paddingTop: 56.25%){\npadding-top: $paddingTop;\nposition: relative;\nwidth: 100%;</p>\n<h1>{$el} {</h1>\n<pre><code>height: 100%;\nleft: 0;\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0;\nwidth: 100%;\n</code></pre>\n<p>  }\n}</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>\n<p>Wrap a selected element in a <code>div</code>.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>const frame = element // frame is the elmeent to be wrapped\nconst div = document.createElement('div');\nframe.parentNode.insertBefore(div, frame);\nframe.parentNode.removeChild(frame);\ndiv.appendChild(frame);</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Add padding to create an intrinsic ratio.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>// where the frame is the element &#x26; the div is the added wrapper element\nconst height = frame.offsetHeight;\nconst width = frame.offsetWidth;\nconst padding = height / width * 100;\ndiv.style.paddingTop = padding + '%';</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Make a plugin for jQuery or <a href=\"http://zeptojs.com/\">Zepto</a>.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>if (window.$) {\nwindow.$.fn.extend({\nreframe: function reframeFunc(cName) {\nreturn reframe(this, cName);\n}\n});\n}</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Add a check to the top of the plugin which allows us to select the element to reframe with jquery <em>or</em> plain js (Kodos to <a href=\"http://jakiestfu.com/\">Jacob Kelley</a> here).</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>let frames = typeof target === 'string' ? document.querySelectorAll(target) : target;\nif (!('length' in frames)) {\nframes = [frames];\n}</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Here's the code you write.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>reframe('selector');</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p data-height=\"380\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"Gjjbak\" data-default-tab=\"css,result\" data-user=\"yowainwright\" data-embed-version=\"2\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/Gjjbak/\">Reframe.js jQuery Demo</a> by Jeff Wainwright (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright\">@yowainwright</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n<h2>To Dos</h2>\n<p>Currently, I'm playing with the idea of removing the default padding of the ratio (56.25%) that's in the <code>css</code> because it is overwritten everytime the plugin is called.\nAlso, I think I will be adding a docs folder for using the plugin &#x26; specific use cases that might come up.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>One of the fun challenges when writing code for content is to support creativity in a controlled way.

This is what <a href=\"https://dollarshaveclub.github.io/reframe.js/\">Reframe.js</a> does. It wraps embedded content in an <a href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video\">intrinsic ratio</a> of the original embed but with fluid sizing so that the embedded content looks great at any size.</p>\n<p data-height=\"380\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"qaaGYV\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"yowainwright\" data-embed-version=\"2\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/qaaGYV/\">Intrinsic Ratio Animation</a> by Jeff Wainwright (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright\">@yowainwright</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n<h2>Why Reframe.js?</h2>\n<p>Previous to writing this plugin, I used <a href=\"http://fitvidsjs.com/\">FitVids</a>. FitVids is a great plugin for solving reframing videos. It's written by 2 of my idols, <a href=\"http://chriscoyier.net/\">Chris Coyier</a> &#x26; <a href=\"http://daverupert.com/\">Dave Ruppert</a>. Fitvids <em>takes a chance</em> that most of your content will be 1 of 5 <code>selectors</code>. If those assumptions are correct (&#x26; if you're using jQuery) - FitVids is golden. If not, there might need to be little extra code on top of the little extra code added that assumes your embedded content will be 1 of 5 <code>selectors</code>. The reason that Reframe.js was originally made was because <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> was not being used on a new product at <a href=\"http://dollarshaveclub.com\">DSC</a>.</p>\n<p>Reframe.js also:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>doesn't assume your reframing just videos (by name at least),</li>\n<li>offers a css mixin rather than inlining css which can make your dom (html) cleaner</li>\n<li>&#x26; offers jQuery plugin that is written in such a way that if unused - it can be shaken out with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/tree-shaking-versus-dead-code-elimination-d3765df85c80#.ccnp22e5f\">Tree shaking</a>.\nThese things make the code lighter initially.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Options</h2>\n<p>The one option supported by Reframe.js is the ability to add your own css class instead of the default css class <code>js-reframe</code>. This is so that the end result of using the library on a webpage is minimal - just 1 inline style added (for the intersic ratio).</p>\n<p>Reframe.js's simplicity in both language &#x26; options is meant to make the plugin easy to understand &#x26; easy to write code to support your product's end goal.</p>\n<h2>Plugin Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>CSS (aspect ratio)</strong></p>\n<p>In this sass mixin, the default aspect ratio is 16:9 but we can override that to make the reframe a perfect ratio of the embed's original size.</p>\n<p>{% highlight sass %}</p>\n<p>@mixin reframe($el: iframe, $paddingTop: 56.25%){\npadding-top: $paddingTop;\nposition: relative;\nwidth: 100%;</p>\n<h1>{$el} {</h1>\n<pre><code>height: 100%;\nleft: 0;\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0;\nwidth: 100%;\n</code></pre>\n<p>  }\n}</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>\n<p>Wrap a selected element in a <code>div</code>.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>const frame = element // frame is the elmeent to be wrapped\nconst div = document.createElement('div');\nframe.parentNode.insertBefore(div, frame);\nframe.parentNode.removeChild(frame);\ndiv.appendChild(frame);</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Add padding to create an intrinsic ratio.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>// where the frame is the element &#x26; the div is the added wrapper element\nconst height = frame.offsetHeight;\nconst width = frame.offsetWidth;\nconst padding = height / width * 100;\ndiv.style.paddingTop = padding + '%';</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Make a plugin for jQuery or <a href=\"http://zeptojs.com/\">Zepto</a>.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>if (window.$) {\nwindow.$.fn.extend({\nreframe: function reframeFunc(cName) {\nreturn reframe(this, cName);\n}\n});\n}</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Add a check to the top of the plugin which allows us to select the element to reframe with jquery <em>or</em> plain js (Kodos to <a href=\"http://jakiestfu.com/\">Jacob Kelley</a> here).</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>let frames = typeof target === 'string' ? document.querySelectorAll(target) : target;\nif (!('length' in frames)) {\nframes = [frames];\n}</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Here's the code you write.</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}</p>\n<p>reframe('selector');</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p data-height=\"380\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"Gjjbak\" data-default-tab=\"css,result\" data-user=\"yowainwright\" data-embed-version=\"2\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/Gjjbak/\">Reframe.js jQuery Demo</a> by Jeff Wainwright (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright\">@yowainwright</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n<h2>To Dos</h2>\n<p>Currently, I'm playing with the idea of removing the default padding of the ratio (56.25%) that's in the <code>css</code> because it is overwritten everytime the plugin is called.\nAlso, I think I will be adding a docs folder for using the plugin &#x26; specific use cases that might come up.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>One of the fun challenges when writing code for content is to support creativity in a controlled way. Reframe.js is a great solve for making embedded content look great on your website. Initially, we didn't know if we would be using jQuery for our product at <a href=\"https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/\">DSC</a> so <a href=\"http://fitvidsjs.com/\">FitVids</a> was out of the question - which led me down the path of writing some new code. The end result was Reframe.js. Hope it works well for you if you use it.</p>\n<p>I plan on writing more lightweight plugins to solve common content problems in the future.

post is a <em>rant</em> attempting to express what seems to be a growing issue: lack of deep thought behind writing HTML for webpages—that will go to production! 🤓 Yes, more time is spent writing that animation, that slider, that app like experience than prioritizing what would probably ensure that customers come to webpages and have a better experience: semantic valid html.\n{: .first-paragraph}</p>\n<h2>Write HTML like a Bulldozer 🚜</h2>\n<p>Developers bulldoze right past truly thinking about HTML. It makes sense! Complex tasks where benefits of thoughtful HTML are just not considered. Not only that, project goals are iterative—they are grown upon and updated in steps. Questions like, <em>is the HTML valid?</em> or <em>is the HTML semantic?</em> are <em>never</em> asked. This small issue then grows on <em>a</em> webpage as new features are added and other websites follow a similar pattern. The world and developers think it's fine because browsers have improved and the webpage looks fine—but is it? </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Questions like, <em>is the HTML valid?</em> or <em>is the HTML semantic?</em> are never asked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What is Semantic HTML beside something we <em>used</em> to care about?</h2>\n<p>Developers, product managers, maybe the whole world at this point assumes <em>it is easy to write [Semantic html](<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic</a></em>HTML)<em>. We should not! Semantic HTML makes webpage content more legible to browsers, search engines, other developers, and is _much</em> easier to maintain. Yet, when looking at source code on <em>many</em> webpages, it is easy to find html that could be semantically improved. </p>\n<h2>Of course my HTML is valid</h2>\n<p>Beyond Semantic HTML, valid HTML is an issue! With browser advancements, checking whether html webpages validate just doesn't happen. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F\">Google Search</a> doesn't render valid html according to W3C spec.</li>\n<li>Neither does <a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252F\">Facebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Validation may not be an issue for Google and Facebook because there usership maybe be so large. However, most websites are <em>not</em> Google or Facebook. This is where the point of valid html is <em>still</em> be a very important thing to consider! 💭</p>\n<h2>Why might this rant matter? …Or are am I just screaming in the wind (again)?</h2>\n<p>Companies looking to grow their audience through webpages should always look to provide rich experiences that can be shared across the most possible platforms in the easiest way. Valid and semantic html would definitely make that easier and with less long run effort. </p>\n<h2>Writing HTML back in the day vs. now</h2>\n<p>Years ago when writing html for webpages, everything that was done had to pass the <a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/\">w3c test</a>. HTML validation tests were even looked at as a tool to find unclosed element tags and fix layout issues. Sure, there where a lot of <code>divs</code> but we could make a webpage render in Internet Explorer 6 <em>as expected</em>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sure, there where a lot of <code>divs</code> but we could make a webpage render in Internet Explorer 6 <em>as expected</em>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As browsers became better, HTML5 elements became more supported, and jQuery allowing easy Dom manipulation HTML testing and review seemed to become more and more of an after thought. Then, the iPhone came and Apps took a front seat.

This post contains a few things that I wasn't completely clear on about Arrow Functions that EFE really clarified for me.</p>\n<h2>Arrow Function Illuminations:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><code>This</code> will be undefined.</li>\n<li>Your can remove even more code cruft that is usually done with Arrow Functions (no mustache brackets needed).</li>\n<li>Arguments which are objects will not work in arrow functions</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Deeper Dive</h2>\n<p>When writing a function normal <code>this</code> can be bound to things (like elements in example). With arrow functions, <em>this</em> (pun intended) is not the case.</p>\n<h3>The This Key Word Is Undefined</h3>\n<p><strong>ES5 Function</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var clickFunction = function clickFunc() {\n  console.log(this);\n  // This would be the selected element\n};\nvar button1 = document.getElementById('button-1');\nbutton1.addEventListener('click', clickFunction, false);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>ES6 Arrow Function</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">document.getElementById('elem').addEventListener('click', () => {\n  console.log(this);\n  // `this` would be undefined\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Remove Even More Cruft With Arrow Functions</h3>\n<p>Arrow functions can be even more minimal but most people add certain things like <code>mustaches</code> for legibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Way of Writing an Arrow Function</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const button2 = document.getElementById('button-2');\nbutton2.addEventListener('click', () => {\n  console.log('Normal arrow function');\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>More Minimal Way An Arrow Function Can Be Written</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const button3 = document.getElementById('button-3');\nbutton3.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('arrow function with less cruft'));\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Objects Cannot Be Used In Arrow Function Arguments</h3>\n<p>Arrow functions can use arguments——as long as they're not objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Way of Writing an Arrow Function</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const button4 = document.getElementById('button-4');\nconst anObj = {\n  name: 'Objecto'\n};\nbutton4.addEventListener('click', (anObj) => {\n  console.log(anObj);\n  // anObj will be undefined\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Arrow Function Notes Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Play with the examples above on <a href=\"http://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/5e5d740b1388b400fc1cc0717f5a29f8\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<p>What the <code>this</code> key word will be bound to and how minimal arrow functions can be is well documented.

After Garret and I moved out, I stopped surfing before I had really started. Fast forward a few years, I met my friend and co-worker <a href=\"http://justinintime.com/\">Justin Berg</a>. We started meeting before work and surfing. Before I knew it, I was going surfing as much as I could. </p>\n<p>As of now, I've been surfing a lot since last September. It challenges and gives me satisfaction. I find even on the days I struggle catching waves or get into a wave just right, I'm given the opportunity to get frustrated in the ocean by myself—and I <em>usually</em> get a better work out. 🙃 Then, some days, I feel something new 'click' and my mind is opened to something new I enjoy about surfing. This past weekend, turning left started to 'click' for me. It felt exhilarating and empowering to be able to consider going either way on a wave (left or right).</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-14/carlsbad-1.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Jetty in Playa Del Ray\" />\n</figure>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-cbf61dbd8898837261236cc6b70d2051-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Week 13, 2017—camping above Ojai on Highway 33, surfing and other things\ndate: \"2017-04-18\"\nlayout: post\nreadNext: \"/\"\npath: \"/week-13-17/\"\nmeta: Week 13, I am doing it—camping above Ojai, surfing and finding to code.\nshow_image: true\nimgix: true\nfeatured_image: \"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-13/hwy-33-3.jpg\"\nshare_image: null\ncategories:\n- note\n- story","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":15,"column":4,"offset":374},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"For the past month, I've been yearning to be outside more. 3 weeks ago, I made that desire a reality by going to Wrightwood.

I was able to have some fun surfing later in the week. I continued to progress in my transfer from 1 team to another at work. Also, my car was side-swiped while I was at Dinner in Venice. All in all, it was a fair week—considering the car side-swiping.</p>\n<h2>Changing Teams</h2>\n<p>Changing teams is tough but great for challenging new skills and learning. The product that I was working on before (a <a href=\"https://content.dollarshaveclub.com/\">content</a> site) still exists leading to fair amount of continued conversation on that product. Meanwhile, I have a whole new stack, (an analytics tool) that I'm working on now. The really cool part of this setup is that I get to work on a lot of things. The not as cool part [for right now], is the amount of different things I'm working on is almost too much to take on all at once. It's a lot for my brain to consume and comprehend when there is context switching between old progress, new team dynamics, new tools and new skills that I need to learn. In this case, 'context switching' means changing up a thought process and/or workflow a lot. </p>\n<p>As far as what I'm learning, I'm getting much more comfortable with Docker. I'm also getting a crash course in debugging. The best thing I've done so far is destroy my local dev box version needlessly a few times and disconnect my local MySQL for the content site which does not run on docker. It hasn't been the most fun but I've gained a lot from debugging and I've been able to work with more developers—very cool.</p>\n<h2>Surfing Time</h2>\n<p>Late the week before last, I was getting out of the water and over extended my leg a bit so I wasn't able to surf. This was good for focusing my time on learning my new workflow at work but still a bummer. </p>\n<p>Then the weekend came and my body was feeling pretty good. I added fins and a leash to my new fun board—a 7'2\" for small wave days. The new board took some getting used to but after a few perls, I was able to get some fun long rides in on Saturday and Sunday. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-11/jetty-1.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Jetty in Playa Del Ray\" />\n</figure>\n<h2>Getting Side-swiped</h2>\n<p>I've often heard that part of being an Angeleno is dealing with what happens when your car incurs damage when parked. Well, if that is the case then I'm officially an Angeleno. I went to dinner on Sunday and came back to tripping on something while getting ready to get into my car. The thing that I tripped on was my side view mirror. Upon closer inspection of my car in the darkness (it was night), my side view mirror was off and it had scratches from my front bumper, on both side doors, and my rear bumper. After going to the body shop I learned it was well over a $1k in damages. The person that ran into my car left no note so 100% of the cost was on me—or so I thought. </p>\n<p>After going to my local body shop, they informed me that I could contact my insurance without filing a claim if I stated, 'I didn't want to file a claim' when the conversation started. So I did that and found the insurance company to be very helpful. After discussing my car issue with my insurance, I found I would only have to pay the co-pay of my damages plus my insurance would not go up! </p>\n<p>All-in-all, I learned new things from side-swipe situation. It is going to cost me about $600 after it's all said and done—WAY better than what I thought.</p>\n<h2>Concluding the week</h2>\n<p>This week will go down as fair because, 'darn-it'—being injured and having my car side-swiped was not fun. However, on the level of learning, it was a big week for me! 🙃</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-39a11bc924a462a65cc280958d7d1c9b-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Week 10, A Week With Few Words\ndate: \"2017-03-27\"\nlayout: post\nreadNext: \"/\"\npath: \"/week-10-17/\"\ncategories:\n-  note\n-  story\nmeta: Week 10, 2017—This was a week with few words as I was transitioning teams at\n  work, sick and injured.\nfeatured_image: null\nshare_image: null","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":14,"column":4,"offset":289},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I'm getting to this post a bit late—1 week.

I'd met this person at the beginning of 2014 and we'd gone on some epic trips together. She helped me a lot with laughter. I first met her when I was recovering from pneumonia. Before having pneumonia I was able to do several things that I haven't been able to do after—like run several miles pretty fast. I was pretty depressed about this change and then my friend made fun of me, \"But you can still run, right?\". She was right. Her vibes about my recovery made me feel okay to complain—because it was like a joke when she'd make fun of me. Her attitube also motivated me to heal. I'm very thankful for her outlook.

Stickybits basically checks for <code>position: sticky</code> support and if the browser doesn't support sticky, the plugin loosely mimics <code>position: sticky</code> with <code>position: fixed</code>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrolldir\">Scrolldir</a> has continued to be a powerful utility plugin that I'm happy to have helped publish. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion, a bit of everything</h2>\n<p>This was another good week of surfing, climbing and writing open source. I'm looking forward to publishing the landing page StickyBits and moving on to writing more utility plugins and supporting my team more in their open source projects. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-7/running-from-water.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Running From Water at Leo Cabrillo\" />\n</figure>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-df9aff88b61c488b3a7492822e4922f8-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Week 6, 2017—Looking for rainbows in the rain, shipping analytics and best\n  friends\ndate: \"2017-02-25\"\nlayout: post\nreadNext: \"/\"\npath: \"/week-6-17/\"\nmeta: Week 6, 2017—This week we shipped analytics at work.
