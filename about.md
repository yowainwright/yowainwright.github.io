Writing software and progressing software is a lifestyle for me. I'm very active in the software engineering community online and in person. Unrelated to software, I [ride road bikes](//www.strava.com/athletes/722335), run and commute as much as possible via skateboard. Lately, my outdoor passion has been surfing which has allowed me to experience the world in a whole new way‚Äîhundreds of feet from land! üèÑ
