Outside of work, I try to be active in the developer community. I ride road bikes, run and commute as much as possible by skateboard. Lately, my outdoor passion has been surfing which has allowed me experience the world in a whole new way - hundreds of feet from land! üèÑ 

I'm not traditionally trained as a software engineer. For 20 years, I wanted nothing else then to be a oil painter. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin in 2003, I worked as a FedEx Service Manager to support my painting. 3 years later I went to design school. It was there, I became passionate about software. I began teaching myself ways to speed up my computer workflows, develop repeatable patterns and think differently about how to solve problems. This naturally led me learning code which I did for a few years before beginning my career in software. üíª
