meta: In a few days it will be 2018. Over the past year, I've released open source products products that I'm proud of. I've begun my journey as a surfer. In 2018 I'm looking forward to improving as a surfer and continuing to hone my skill as a software engineer.

**Forword:** Large portions of this post are reflections. There is a little spice so hopefully, **you** can share some confluence with the writing in this post. I am a dreamer by nature. I am also extremely motivated by challenge. There is a gap between these attributes which can lead a lot of nothing getting done. I try to actually get things done by using defined goals with consumable items to turn dreams into reality. This is really hard for me because I find myself thinking, _'Challenged accepted!'_, as well as, _'I want to do that'_ or _'I want to make that'_ as I hear on think about new ideas all of the time. I am a _'yes'_ man. I've been trying to improve that about myself. I want to say _'yes'_ to things I'm passionate about and get better at avoiding things that I am not. This hard for me because I feel selfish. Through figures that influence me I've learned to believe in the phrase, _'you cannot fill others up when you, yourself, are empty_. That phrase is incredibly romantic to me. It makes me feel like every _'no'_ I speak allows me to give a bigger _'yes'_ for the things I love.

2017 was a productive year for me. I had unexpected wins and did not achieve a few major goals I set out to achieve. In 2018, I will be following up on the few goals that I didn't achieve in 2017 as well as working on new goals. In this post, I will reflect on 2017. I will breakdown each of the goals I set. I will roughly plan goals for 2018. 

## High level goal summaries by year

**In 2017** I set goal for myself to improve my skill at surfing while continuing to ride my bike and run. I also, set a goal to become a senior software engineer to my standards. I also set process goals for myself including: stretching 10 minutes 2 times a day and writing a blog post each week. I achieved approximately 50% of goals. 

**In 2018**, my goal surfing is to become more profecient going left. I would like to ride my bike a few hundred miles more than 2017 but mainly switch my cardiovascular training to running. Professionally, I will continue my goal to become a senior software engineer to my standards. I plan to write fewer blog posts but put more focus on the quality of each post. 

## Surfing has become a big part of my life, these are my surfing goals 

In late 2016, I started surfing. It was so challenging for me. It still is. I kept doing it through the challenges of struggling to paddle and/or e
