meta: "Pragmatism has often told me that dreams cannot become real unless they're followed by an actionable plan. I've share this logic with friends when they tell me an unrealistic dream and to my surprise, 'thanks' was not the typical response. Responses tended to be negative. Dreams are often just that, dreams. Let then live if they make others happy."

I remember being in high school and listening to my first long term girlfriend tell me about her dreams for the future. She dreamed that was going to live in Europe, be a writer, then an artist. She dreamed that Her very quiet nature was going to change as she was also going to act in plays. Hearing her dreams made me sad then. These dreams made me sad because 1. she probably could have done all of those things (she was annoyingly talented), 2. none of her dreams included a future I could live in. I couldn't just go to Europe on a whim—what about my dream—to live in a Mansion outside of Chicago! More clearly on point 2, she didn't even consider me in her dreams.

Being pragmatic about her responses, I brought how quiet she was. I asked her how should would afford to live in Europe and be a write/artist. I followed up with where I stood in this whole fairytale dream. I wasn't considered once, dammit! I recall her face. She clenched her lips as if she'd been silenced. She didn't say anything else about her dreams after. Remembering my high school self, I probably took advantage of her silenced dreams to talk about all of the fun high school stuff I had going on—wrestling matches, hanging with my friends, maybe a good joke about how awesome I was—important stuff!

Of course, my high school girlfriend and I broke up when we went off to differing schools in completely different areas of the country. Her dreams fell way to a much more pragmatic reality.

To get to my thought, this rant is not about my first girlfriend. This post is about the difference between a day-dream and an actionable planned out idea (a realistic dream).

In reflection of the interaction with my first girlfriend and countless conversations after, I've judged, belittled, or become upset about day dreams people I'm close to have shared with me. I challenged these shared emotional day-dreamlike comments with logic—crushing the thought down. I pointed out errors where these day dreams didn't make sense. I've laughed.

At some level, in the right context this can be a good thing. If someone that I care about comes to me with an actionable planned out idea, critique and questioning can be a game-changer for an idea's success. However, for day dreams, critiqued comments have an opposite effect. Not only does criticism of day dreams critisize the day dream, it critisizes the intemency of the sharer and the listener. This is why I now try to let the dream live!
