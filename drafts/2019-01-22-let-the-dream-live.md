I've share this logic with friends when they tell me an unrealistic dream and to my surprise, 'thanks' was not the typical response. Responses tended to be negative. Dreams are often just that, dreams. Let then live if they make others happy."

When we care about someone, it can be challenging to nuture goals and listen to dreams. There is a difference between goals and dreams to me. A goal has plan broken down into specific action items. Each action item is doable making the goal attainable. A dream is emotionally based. The are no doable action items. It is unrealistic in its current state. A dream can become a goal with nuturing and planned action items but in it's initial state it is not. This is important thing to consider with our close relationships because the way that we respond to each thought type should be different. Nurturing the dreams and goals of people we care about is beneficial. Challenging goals can be help achieve goals while challenging dreams can be stiffeling.

## Crushing My High School Girlfriend's Dreams

In high school, I remember listening to my girlfriend tell me about her dreams for the future. She dreamed that was going to live in Europe, be a writer and artist. She dreamed that she was act in plays. Hearing her dreams made me sad then. These dreams made me sad because she probably could have done all of those things (she was annoyingly talented) and none of her dreams included a future I was live in. I couldn't just go to Europe on a whim. How could we afford to live? What about my dream to live in a Mansion outside of Chicago? More clearly, she didn't even consider me in her dreams which in that moment signified that she could envision an end to our relationship.

I retorted with dream-crushing pragmatism towards what she had told me. I brought up how quiet she was. I asked her how should would afford to live in Europe and be a writer/artist. I followed up with where I stood in this whole fairytale dream. I wasn't considered once, dammit! I recall her face after my comments. She clenched her lips. She'd been silenced. She didn't say anything else about her dreams to me after that moment.

## Synopsis

Dreams and goals are differing thought types. They arey closely related but different. Goals are broken down with action items. Dreams are ideas without action items. When a person communicates an dream, it should be listened to and encouraged. Dreams offer people an outlet from the structure and demand of everyday life. When a person communicates goal, questioning it's action items can help greatly in achieving success. Others may see flaws or opportunities for improvement. The subtle difference between dreams and goals are subjects of much human unhappiness in their most important relationships.

## Dreams (Daydreams) Are Important to Human Happiness

Everyday life can seem mundane living in our own skin every day. Dreams assist in allowing us to escape our everyday life. We explore ideas, places, and things that are not realistic in the moment.

An example of a common dream pattern happens when adults go into unionship and begin considering growing a family. These thoughts demand serious consideration. Unsurprisingly with the stress these changes and the sacrafices involved, dreams that seem directly opposed to these changes come up. It would be hard to go into building a family without considering the freedom of singularity so dreaming about another path seems obvious.

Dreams may not be unrealistic forever but they are until action items are provided to make them achievable, they're feelings that make us feel good or different than reality.

## Goals Are Important to Success and Fulfillment

Goals often start out as dreams. With specific actionable items, goals can be achieved. Once a goal is a goal and not a dream, challenging and critiquing them can provide benefit to a goal's success.

The benefit of challenging goals versus pain that can be felt by challenging dreams is important for relationship growth and individual happiness.
