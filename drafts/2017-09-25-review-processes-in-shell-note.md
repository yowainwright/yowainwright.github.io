Listed below is one way to find running processes with a shell. This is useful when debugging.

Example command for finding running `ruby` processes.
```sh
ps aux | grep -i ruby
```

Breaking down that command

```sh
# display processes
ps
# flag => all processes
aux
# isolate search of processes
grep -i
# the process we're isolating
ruby
```
