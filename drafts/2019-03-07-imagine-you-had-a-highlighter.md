Listening is tough. Even when listening closely, the information is received by the listener can be very different than the information that is meant to be conveyed by the speaker. Furthermore, what information is most important to be understood by the speaker can be very different from what information is understood to be the most important information to be received from the speaker by the listener. It is for reasons like misunderstanding of dialogue and misunderstanding of key phrases within dialogue that many disagreements happen among people who care about each other or at least want to work together. It is for this reason I've grown fond of the idea of a a highlighter pen that could highlight spoken words.

Imagine there was a highlighter pen that could highlight spoken words. With this highlighter, speakers could highlight what was most important in what they were saying. How many relationships could be saved? How much closer could we be to people we care about? How many business ideas could be carried out? In reflection, there are many conversations where I think, "If I only had a highlighter to highlight spoken words, this coversation would have gone much differently.". Instead, I tend to ramble on, hoping that something I say conveys my intent.

## Rambling on trying to convey my particular intent is a risky game I love to play, apparently

For a long time, I've subtly been aware that often what I'm trying to convey is not what is understood by my audience. Having this awareness, I tend to choose to make it worse by trying to convey the same information differently. This often leads to listeners thinking that I'm rambling, feeling shut down, or being hurt by one of my numerous ways of trying to convey an exact thing. This has happened at key points for me; moments where I wanted to be precise to make my listener feel understood or cared for. The difficult part is, in my long-windness, I mute my point, block them from speaking, or say something incorrectlyâ€”even worse. Having done this a few times recently, thinking of a solution to this negative pattern became necessary.

## If I had a spoken word highlighter, I'd say it once and highlight the good s**t

## Other spoken word helpful concents

## Conclusion, healing from the problem of saying too much
