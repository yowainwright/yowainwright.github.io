Listening is tough. Even when listening closely, what information is received by the listener can be very different than what information is meant to be conveyed by the speaker. Imagine there was a highlighter pen that could highlight spoken words. With this highlighter, speakers could highlight what was most important in what they were saying. How many relationships could be saved? How much closer could we be to people we care about? In reflection, there are many conversations where, if I had a highlighter, I think coversations would have gone much differently.
