Remembering back to when Covid started feels like a different lifetime ago. 
My life is better now in _almost_ every way except for one—my psychical health! I've developed tired legs, a hunched back, and the beginnings of Carpal Tunnel from long hours of Covid computing. This article will cover those ailments and what I am doing to get my body closer to what it was before Covid. Many of the fixes that have worked are obvious but I find doing them more challenging during Covid. 

> My speculation is that during Covid, it has become easy to 'live at work' rather than 'work from home'. To me, 'living at work' means that I'm sort of always working. I know, theoretically, it is easy to 'push back' and/or 'not respond' during off hours but 'working from home' seems to have spread out the work force. In example, I and someone on the East Coast can have office hours of 10-6 but we're dealing with a 3 hours difference. I find that difference always gets made up by myself and the other person working before or after our set hours to maximize our productivity. I find my mind seems to default over time too, 'Well, I'm already home'. 

## Ailment: Tired Legs

I've always been a fitness enthusiast. 
I'm an avid runner, surfer, and I do other cardio and calisthenic exercises—like cycling and lifting weights to keep my body fit.
To give this some context, pre-covid I would go to the gym around 3 times a week, run 20-30 miles a week and surf 4-6 times a week. Not the most for an active person in Los Angeles but I felt good!

Once Los Angeles first quarantine hit, the gyms where closed and surfers weren't supposed to surf at the beaches—so I didn't. This meant I could run and I did. I upped my miles per week from 20-30 to 40-60. Initially, I felt okay (considering a pandemic with unknown consequences had hit), and was keeping my body in the best shape I could considering the situation. Besides running a lot, I was working on my bed or placing my laptop on my dresser along with a $10 Ikea chair. 

After a few months of Covid, it became clear that there was no quick end in sight. Personally, upping my running miles from 20-30 miles per week to 60+ at my peek had taken a toll on my legs. They were always feeling tired. My running pace was getting slower and slower. Besides my legs, my back and body has begun to have weird pains from all of my awkward contortions to work on my bed or make-shift desk. With the help of my girlfriend, now wife I began to make changes to better accommodate my new Covid desk life. 

## Tools for Tired Legs

Tired legs has not been an easy fix for me! I've thought I've been out of the woods several times only to go fun a run and still fill the same lag that started after the first few months of Covid.
