I stopped posting to this blog in September last year, 2017. It was an easy decision to make. There were specific reasons I stopped but I couldn't articulate them at the time. In this post, I'm going to articulate why I stopped writing posting.

## Find meaning in the meaningless—a long-winded side-step to this post's point

My living parents diplomats. They travel around the world. When I tell people about their work and my childhood, people say something like, "What a cool life to live!". They're right, it was cool. However, my parents' lives and work always came before my life.

Until my mid-thirties, I had know idea who I was. I felt no value. Then when I turned 33, I started on a journey of learning to love myself. It felt as cheesy as it sounds. People would often observe that I was overly positive. I seemed fake. I would often subconsciously say, 'Fake it until you make it!'.

My first inclination to learn to love myself was to find someone else to love me. I failed miserably. Looking back, it's gotta be hard to love someone who has no idea who they are, seems fake, and is having conversations with themselves—'Fake it until you make it!'.

My second inclination to learn to love myself was by letting go of memories that made me not love myself. I road 10,000 miles on a bicycle—mostly in solitude. I cried sometimes on the road. I got upset sometimes. I told myself, 'All of your pain—put it on the road!'. I did let old emotions go and I did find a part of myself that I didn't know about. It wasn't what I expected. I imagined my journey would matter more to others but it didn't. It was a journey for me and it only mattered to me but that wasn't all. When I let go of those of hard feeling and when I saw so much beauty, I had more to give when I was around people.

After getting injured from bike riding, I felt done with inclinations of escape—in some one or somewhere. I felt acceptance of myself. I felt aware of personality traits I need to improve, weakness, and strengths. I came up with a few slogans for myself—things that I feel are true to me. I'm displined person who craetes a place of thoughtful true. I'm dedicated, satisfied, and want to feel good. I listen and confront problems when it is needed even if it is hard.

## Okay, here's why I stopped writing post and I'm starting again

Here's why I stopped writing posts: last August, I realized that the respect I hoped for through my dedication to design, exercise, and software might never come. I had felt for a while that my posts were like whispers in the wind. It was tough to realize that. That fantasy that had motivated me since childhood—that someday my dedication to my passions would matter to a wider audience. I somewhat secretly hoped that the invisibility I felt in reality was a case of circumstance. I fantasied that through effort in my passions that I would find a clan where my ideas would matter.

## Well, why am I writing this post now

After accepting that the posts I was writing may not ever help find a clan or reach a wider audience, I decided to find excitment and passion in other writing, videos, and work. I stopped posting. I would add updates to this site to keep up with technologies but that was it!

Months went by without me writing posts. I was able to maintain excitment about my passions and have acceptance about my lack of clan. I realized that I lost my own personal context which is important for me. My own personal context helps me to learn, maintain timelines for my memories, and retain what I've learned! So all of this being written, I hope to start posting. My goal is to keep my posts a little long than tweets with information about my life and/or my learnings. That's it!
