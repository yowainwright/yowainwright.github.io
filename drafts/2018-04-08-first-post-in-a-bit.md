I stopped posting to this blog in September last year, 2017. It was an easy decision to make. There were specific reasons I stopped but I couldn't articulate them at the time. In this post, I'm going to articulate why I stopped writing posting.

## Find meaning in the meaningless—a long-winded side-step to this post's point

My living parents diplomats. They travel around the world. When I tell people about their work and my childhood, people say something like, "What a cool life to live!". They're right, it was cool. However, my parents' lives and work always came before my life.

Until my mid-thirties, I had know idea who I was. I felt no value. Then when I turned 33, I started on a journey of learning to love myself. It felt as cheesy as it sounds. People would often observe that I was overly positive. I seemed fake. I would often subconsciously say, 'Fake it until you make it!'.

My first inclination to learn to love myself was to find someone else to love me. I failed miserably. Looking back, it's gotta be hard to love someone who has no idea who they are, seems fake, and is having conversations with themselves—'Fake it until you make it!'.

My second inclination to learn to love myself was by letting go of memories that made me not love myself. I road 10,000 miles on a bicycle—mostly in solitude. I cried sometimes on the road. I got upset sometimes. I told myself, 'All of your pain—put it on the road!'. I did let old emotions go and I did find a part of myself that I didn't know about. It wasn't what I expected. I imagined my journey would matter more to others but it didn't. It was a journey for me and it only mattered to me but that wasn't all. When I let go of those of hard feeling and when I saw so much beauty, I had more to give when I was around people.

After getting injured from bike riding, I felt done with inclinations of escape—in some one or somewhere. I felt acceptance of myself. I felt aware of personality traits I need to improve, weakness, and strengths. I came up with a few slogans for myself—things that I feel are true to me. I'm displined person who craetes a place of thoughtful true. I'm dedicated, satisfied, and want to feel good. I listen and confront problems when it is needed even if it is hard.

## Okay, here's why I stopped writing post and I'm starting again

That last paragraph written, here's why I stopped writing posts. Last August, I began to realize that the respect I hoped I'd have might never come. I felt like my posts might as well be whispers in the wind. That was a tough realization for me. That fantacy was something I had thought about since childhood.

## Well, why am I writing this post now
