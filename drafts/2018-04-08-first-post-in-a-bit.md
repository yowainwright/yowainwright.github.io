I stopped posting to this blog in September last year, 2017. It was an easy decision to make. There was a reason I stopped but I couldn't articulate it at the time. In this post, I'm going to make an attempt to articulate why I stopped writing posting.

## Find meaning in the meaningless—a long-winded side-step to the point of this post

I am not close to my living parents. They're diplomats. They travel around the world. When I tell people about their work and my childhood, people say something like, "What a cool life to live!". They're right, it was cool. However, their lives and work always came before my life.

Until my mid-thirties, I had know idea who I was. I felt no value. Then when I turned 33, I started on a journey of self-love. It felt as cheesy as it sounds. People would often observe that I was overly positive. I think I seemed fake. I would often subconsciously say, 'Fake it until you make it!'.

My first inclination for self-love was to find love. I failed miserably. Looking back, it's gotta be hard to love someone who has no idea who they are, seems fakely positive, and is having conversations with themselves, 'Fake it until you make it!'.

My second inclination for self-love was to find love by letting go. I road 10,000 miles on a bicycle—mostly in solitude. I told myself, 'All of your pain and shame—put it on the road!'.

After going through injury from so much bike riding, I felt done with inclinations of escape in some one or somewhere. I am me—5'8", bald, full of self-doubt, awkward, but with so much appreciation. I do work I love. I do activities I love. I feel okay about a reality where my biggest success at 38 will be knowing myself.

## Almost back to the point—why I stopped writing posts

Okay, 1 more paragraph before I get into why I stopped writing posts. I'll get there!

When I was young, living abroad or state-side, I would dream of a word that revolved around me—where I would have the respect people had for my parents by default. It always had to do with how smart I would be, or how talked I would be. I would fantisize about how then I would share my insights and help other people who felt alone like me.

## Okay, here's why I stopped writing post and I'm starting again

That last paragraph written, here's why I stopped writing posts. Last August, I began to realize that the respect I hoped I'd have might never come. I felt like my posts might as well be whispers in the wind. That was a tough realization for me. That fantacy was something I had thought about since childhood.
