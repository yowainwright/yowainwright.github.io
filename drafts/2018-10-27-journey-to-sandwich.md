I’m an average dude in almost every way. I'm not the smartest, most athletic, or really charismatic—none of that. Maybe if I have a bit of an unusual trait, it's my sensitivity. But, that's not for this article. I have been bless (had a lot given to me): education, travel, and an opportunity to work continually. I know it and I feel it a lot. Probably not as much as I should, but a lot. I think, "how did I get so lucky to have been given so much?". I feel incredibly thankful but all that I have been given can feel like a mixed bag (good and bad). In this post I'm going to attempt to explore these feelings.

> I only have what I have from some sort of lucky draft in the universe.

I assume it is better to question inadequacy with a full belly in a safe community—but I struggle with a truth everyday. I only have what I have from some sort of lucky draft in the universe. The universe blessed me to parents in a community that provided me with good education, travel, and an opportunity. In the travels I did, I came to be aware that I have more than others because of luck. I cannot forget this fact.

I think about my luck often. I go to nice grocery market many mornings to get food or a breakfast sandwich. I envision the journey of those who serve me egg sandwiches at 7am. Did they sleep in a house with tons of people just to afford to call LA home? Did they get up at 3am to drive hours to my community to listen to people in my complain? Did they listen to gun shots, travel in fear of violence to them? What do they do when they’re sick? What journeys led them to my egg sandwich?

It’s funny, maybe rediculous even; while I get my sandwich how happy many that serve me seem and how sad I feel. There is no purpose to my opportunity. I’m avarage and I’m alone—with an amazing egg sandwich. I could hope that I had some purpose but I know enough that I’m not special.
