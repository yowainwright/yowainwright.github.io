We, humans, all have a journey. We have moments that form who we are. Recent studies even show that our journey and reactions happen before we're even [born](). We're instinctualâ€”not just as humans but as ancestors, like of our parents.  This post won't dig into ancestral instincts. However, ancestral instincts are relevant to this post. One parent and myself share a similar ancestral instinct. We both naturally take on a victim mentality. This victim mentality has put me in a space of abuse and my reaction to abuse has paved the way for how I react to people I'm close to and sometimes people I'm not even close to. "This is where I will meet you.", it may seem like a boundary for me but it is not. It's a truth that I've lived with for most of my life. Over the past year, I've stepped out of falling into a victim mentality by beginning claim what I want and where I will meet people I'm in contact with. For parts of this post, I will write non-specifically to focus on my truth with not directly involving others.
