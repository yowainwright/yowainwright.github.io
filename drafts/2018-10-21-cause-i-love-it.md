Commercially, "just doing it" is clear in regards to chasing dreams and ideas. If a person has an dream, they should go for it! If a person has an idea, it should become a reality! There is little argument about _going for your dreams_ or _making ideas reality_. Furthermore, a reality is personified that with effort (more effort than everyone else), your dreams and ideas can happen! Reality is a bit more harsh. Not every dream comes true and not every idea is good one.

I've read articles about the reality of "just doing it" and the harsh truth that most dreams and ideas don't come into fruition. This post is _slightly_ different. This post is written with an awareness that there is only one Michael Jordan in basketball and no matter how hard millions of people have tried, they don't attain that level of skill.

This post reflects on what happens when it is clear to person that they're not the best, excelling or even skilled at something and they still do it.
