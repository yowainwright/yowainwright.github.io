Commercially, "just doing it" is clear in regards to chasing dreams and ideas. If a person has an dream, they should go for it! If a person has an idea, it should become a reality. There is little argument about _going for your dreams_ or _making ideas reality_. Furthermore, a reality is personified that with effort (more effort than everyone else), your dreams and ideas can happen! Reality is a bit more harsh. Not every dream comes true and not every idea is good one.

I've read articles about the reality of "just doing it" and the harsh truth that most dreams and ideas don't come into fruition. This post is slightly different. This post is written with an awareness that I am not the next Michael Jordan and, in high school, no matter how hard I tried, I could not have made the high school basketball team. Yep, the harsh reality of that dreamâ€”my dream to become the next Michael Jordan, came crashing down when I was young and far away from achieving my goal. What I choose to do, knowing that I'm not the next Michael Jordan, is what this post is about.

In high school, to everyone else, me quitting basketball meant nothing. It was not even acknowledged. If I would have kept persuing even basketball, it would seem silly. If I would have said it out loud, "I want to be the next Michael Jordan", people probably would have started laughing. Basketball makes someone's level of ability very clear. People could tell by my lack of cordination and height along with average shooting ability that me becoming the next Michael Jordan was impossible.

Other activities are not as clear.
