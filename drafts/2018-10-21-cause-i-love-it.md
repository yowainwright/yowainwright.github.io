Commercially, "just doing it" is clear in regards to chasing dreams and ideas. If a person has an dream, they should go for it! If a person has an idea, it should become a reality! There is little argument about _going for your dreams_ or _making ideas reality_. Furthermore, a reality is personified that with effort (more effort than everyone else), your dreams and ideas can happen! Reality is a bit more harsh. Not every dream comes true and not every idea is good one.

I've read articles about the reality of "just doing it" and the [harsh truth](http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/estimated-probability-competing-professional-athletics) that most dreams and ideas don't come into fruition. This post is _slightly_ different. This post is written with an awareness that there is only one [Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan) in basketball and no matter how hard millions of people have tried, they don't attain that level of skill.

## Some people just do it despite there being no ryhme-or-reason

Isn't it cool that despite not having any skill, people "just do it"? To me, this is so cool. People are generally terrible at something but deep down inside, their says, "Not stopping me. I'm gonna do this shit way more!". We (humans) gripe about taxes which take a few hours and most any of us can do. Yet, we find something that we love, are terrible, and frustrates us—and still do it A LOT.
