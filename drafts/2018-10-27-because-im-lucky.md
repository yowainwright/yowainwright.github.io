I’m an average dude in almost every way who’s had much given to me: education, travel, and opportunity from the education and travel I’ve had. Does it feel good? It’s a mixed bag.

I mean, I know it is better to question inadequacy while fed in a safe community—but I have a truth I struggle with everyday. I only have what I have from some sort of lucky draft in the universe. The universe blessed me to parents in a community that provided me with good education and travel. In the travels I did, I came to be very aware, I have more than others not from ethics, wisdom, or skill, but because of luck. I cannot forget this fact.

I think about my luck often. I go to Whole Foods many mornings. I envision the journey of those who serve me egg sandwiches at 7am. Did they sleep in a house with tons of people just to afford to call LA home? Did they get up at 3am to drive hours to my community to listen to people complain? Did they listen to gun shots, travel in fear of violence to them? What do they do when they’re sick? What journeys led them to my egg sandwich?

It’s funny, maybe rediculous even; while I get my sandwich how happy many that serve me seem and how sad I feel. There is no purpose to my opportunity. I’m avarage and I’m alone—with an amazing egg sandwich. I could hope that I had some purpose but I know enough that I’m not special.
