First off, I don’t have the answer to why throwing temper tantrums feel so good. I do know it feels good. I’d go so far as to say, it feels great!!! Initially, I have no idea why but I’d like to know. Please tell me.

So, I’m nervous to share, I throw temper tantrums. I do it a lot—once a day on average. Usually when I’m getting ready for work. Sometimes when I’m hungry. Whenever I call customer service. When I make a silly mistake. When my focus get distracted. Is it a lot a lot of temper tantrum throwing? I don’t know. Please tell me!

My temper tantrums are not long, directed at anyone or violent. They feel great! Initially, they feel great. That is, they feel great until I’ve been caught. Then embarrassment and self doubt sets in. It sets in more when I listen to pretty much any self help stuff that talks about being composesd is being alpha. That sort of talk makes me feel beta. At 38 my emotional sentiment is, f**k it, I’m beta—why stop my temper tantrums now? Well, why stop my temper tantrums? Is there a reason beyond seeming crazy? Like does it cause cancer? I don’t know. Please tell me!

I know that when I shout, “God, F**king S**t”  it is startling to others when I get caught. I feel really bad...but not as good as I feel when I shout “God, F**king S**t” and don’t get caught. It feels great! Like I appeased my pain and I’m back feeling mentally level.

I don’t want to stop throwing temper tantrums. It’s part of me, I guess. I want to shout. I want to let out the bad stuff with a hard reset, like resetting a video game before dying. But, I don’t want to startle others. I don’t want to bother others. I want to live in my own world and say f**k it; resetting the s**t so I can start anew. Is this rediculous? I don’t know. Please tell me!
