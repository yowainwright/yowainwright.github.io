Verbal expression and psychical expression can be very different. This can alter the reception of communications.

> Is simple terms, if a person angrily yells, "Have a good day!", there is a probability that the reception of that comment will not be received as, "Thanks! I will have a good day.".

I think about how my verbal communications are received by others a lot because I want to be a better communicator. This short post documents things I've noticed in communication that alter the perception of conversations. My observations are natural and I'm not expert in communication—more like the opposite.

## Making others feel good in basic communication

There are simple communications that people can do to make others feel good—smiling, telling  a joke, listening. To me, writing that—it seems obvious but it is not. A joke can be misunderstood, someone has to talk to you for you to listen, and even a smile can be misunderstood in the write context. When I think about it, what's the simplest way to make someone feel good? I'm not sure. It's nuanced. Below, I'm going to break it down a little bit. There is no data to support my thoughts. My observations are my own.

### Smiling

I thought when I was younger that a smile would always make someone feel good. Maybe it did—when I was younger. Now, I'm older. If I smile at someone I don't know, my smile could be received as an intent to engage. This is negative. I've found that smiling at others is received positively when the opportunity of further engagement is low. Meaning that if I smile at someone as they are leaving in a car, there is high chance that the smile will be received positively.

### Jokes

Jokes are one of best and most important ways to engage in conversation. They convey a connection to the receiver. Jokes require that the audience is listening but unlike smiles, they can lead to engaging in conversation—even if they're not understood. The key to joke telling, beyond a joke, is positive body language. Positive body language is laughing with your body. I'm not an expert here. Mostly plainly laughing is a good start.

### Listening

Listening is a great way to become closer to someone. In order to listen to someone they must want to communicate with you.

## Beings received well in difficult communication

### Speaking softly

### Keeping communications short

### Owning emotions

## Conclusions
