Verbal communication and psychical communication can be very different. This can alter the reception of communications.

> Is simple terms, if a person angrily yells, "Have a good day!", there is a probability that the reception of that comment will not be received as, "Thanks! I will have a good day.".

I think about how verbal communication and psychical communication are received by others a lot because I want to be a better communicator. This post documents things I've noticed in human expression that alter the perception of conversations. My observations are natural. I'm not expert in communication—more like the opposite. I often walk away from situations thinking, "I didn't do a good job with my expressions. What could I have done better?".

## Making others feel good in basic communication

There are simple communications that people can do to make others feel good—smiling, telling  jokes, listening. To me, writing that—it seems obvious. It is not! A joke can be misunderstood. Someone has to talk to you for you to listen. Even a smile can be misunderstood in the wrong context. When I think about it, what's the simplest way to make someone feel good? I'm not sure. It's nuanced. Below, I'm going to break down things I have observed with both poor and good human expression. There is no data to support my thoughts. My observations are my own.

### Smiling

When I was younger, I thought that smiles always make someone feel good. Maybe they did—when I was younger. Now, I'm older. In simple communication like passing by someone, if I smile at them, my smile may be received as an intent to engage. Engaging someone in unwanted communication is negative. I've found that smiling at others is received positively in simple communication when the opportunity of further engagement is low. Meaning that if I smile at someone as they are leaving in a car, there is high chance that the smile will be received positively.

Alternatively, if I smile at someone and walk towards them, how a smile will be received is much more unkown.At that point, it is very much on how the persom perceives and receives the smile. This scenerio is now complex and beyond simple expression. A much simplier why to smile at someone and have it guaranteed to be received negatively is to smile when they're upset or negative. It could even be speculated that to a upset person, expressions of being upset one's self could be perceived more positively than smiling.

### Jokes

Jokes are one of best and most important ways to engage in conversation. They convey a connection to the receiver. Jokes require that the audience is listening but unlike smiles, they can lead to engaging in conversation—even if they're not understood. The key to joke telling, beyond a joke, is positive body language. Positive body language is laughing with your body. I'm not an expert at laughing with my body. Most plainly, laughing is a good start.

### Listening

Listening is a great way to become closer to someone. In order to listen to someone they must want to communicate with you. A friend of mine had a joke when we were in college. He would shout to girls, while drinking, "What's your story?". It was funny to listeners because it was clear, that they would not want to tell him their story. This was an interesting concept then and I still remember those situations with my friend now. The concept is still interesting to me now because I wonder when being an engaged listener becomes a positive thing. It seems clear that someone has to be aware of you to want to share their story with you. The also have to feel comfortable. So it seems that in order to be engaged listener, people must also be active in conversations prior. I'm not clear on the power of engaging and listening. I love how great it feels to be in an engaged conversation of "story sharing" but I don't know how to get there.

## Being received well in difficult communication

Difficult communication is very important. I have never met someone good in difficult communication and not in a position of power. It is a  rare skill. And from observation, difficult communication seems easier than listening, joking, and making others feel good but it is not. This is something I view as a flaw with humanity. Difficult communication is difficult, not because of what needs to be said. Humans are great at seeing opportunities for improvement in others! Difficult communication is difficult because of the emotions that most people feel when delivering difficult communication. So, often people that are talented at difficult communication have less emotion than others might have. To me this means that when providing difficult communication, being concise and as calm as possible is key.

### Speaking softly

Speaking softly is great for communication. It makes people feel comfortable. It naturally brings people closer because they have to get closer to listen. Being a passionate person, I have become very aware that a large part of communicate is not what is said but how it is said. Controlling pitch and voice inflection are very hard. Speaking softly is an easier thing to do on the fly. Especially when communicating about things with passion or intensity.

### Keeping communications short

Keeping communications short allows others to contribute their ideas and also, ensure that they understond you. This goes against natural inclination when trying to communicate about complex things but giving listeners the opportunity to digest information or ask for clarification will lead to much more understanding for them of what you've said.

### Owning emotions

Even when we have a bad day, we have to communicate with others. We all wish that we could generally hide our emotions but people have instincts. They'll often times know something is not right. They may think that it has to do with them when it has to do with you. Letting them know that you're having a bad day but you want to talk with them allows then to not read into your verbal queues.

## Conclusions

Communication is tough! For people that it comes naturally to, it is very powerful. Others will gravitate towards them.
