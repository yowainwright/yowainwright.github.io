Verbal expression and psychical expression can be very different. This can alter the reception of communications.

> If a person angrily yells, "Have a good day!", there is a probability that the reception of that comment will not be received as, "Thanks! I will have a good day.".

I think about how my verbal communcations are received by others. I want to be a better communcator. This short post documents things I've noticed in communication that alter the perception of conversations.

## Making others feel good in basic communcation

There are simple communcations that people can do to make others feel good—smiling, telling a joke, or listening. To me, writing that—it seems obvious but in life I find that often, it is not. A joke can be misunderstood. Someone has to feel open to talk to you for you to listen. Even a smile can be misunderstood in the right context. When I think about it, what's the simplist way to make someone feel good? I'm not sure. It's nuanced. Below, I'm going to break it down as much as I can. There is no data or article to support my thoughts. My observations are my own.

### Smiling

I thought when I was younger that a smile would always make someone feel good. I think it did—when I was younger. Now, I'm older. If I smile at someone I don't know, my smile could be received as an intent to engage. This is negative. I've found that smiling at others is received positively when the opportunity of further engagement is low. Meaning that if I smile at someone as they are leaving in a car, there is high chance that the smile will be received positively.

### Jokes

Jokes are one of best and most important ways to engage in conversation. They convey a connection to the receiver. Jokes require that the audience is listening but unlike smiles, they can lead to engaging in conversation—even if they're not understood. The key to joke telling, beyond a joke, is positve body language. Positive body language is laughing with your body. I'm not an expert here. Mostly plainly laughing is a good start.

### Listening

Everyone longs to be listened to. People often express loneliness relating it human companionship but often after listening to people I sense that people's deepest desire is to be understood. People
