meta: Disillusion was something that I heard about continually from locals speaking about how their country collapsed in Albania, Bosnia, and the Czech Republic. Now, I sense a similar sentiment in the United States.

Part of my life growing up, I lived internationally. I lived in Albania, Bosnia and the Czech Republic after the fall or communism, or, in Bosnia's situation, war. The common sentiment that I would hear from people I would ask before of the time before the fall of communism or war was, 'They felt disillusioned. The country was led to believe 1 thing and that was not the case.'. Upon reflection, this is deeply concerning to me know because I hear similar sentiments today in the United States.

> They felt disillusioned. The country was led to believe something that was not the case.

In the post, I will describe rough sentiments that I heard and relate them to things that I have heard or read recently.

## Albanians were told they had the best quality of life in the world

## Communism in Russia and the Czech Republic was an age thing—sort of

## In Bosnia, people weren't bounded by love but by common things to hat
