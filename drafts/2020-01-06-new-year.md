A swell came to Southern California the last days of 2019 giving SoCal Surfers the opportunity to shred into the new year. I was one of them. I surfed Ventura Point and El Porto into the new year. It was a good way to wrap 2019 which in no way went as expected for me.  

I started out the year focused on becoming better at [Functional Programming](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0) and [Typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) but later changed my focus to art, interpersonal communication, and [nervous system healing](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/20/the-body-keeps-the-score-van-der-kolk/) via acupuncture. I couldn’t have imagined the journeys and adventures I had last year. Almost nothing I experienced I would have expected even at the very end of 2019. 

## Functional Programming, simplicity and expectations

Functional Programming is a way of programming where an expected input always delivers an expected output. Many engineers believe functional programming is easier to understand once its patterns are more understood and it generally easier to test—an expected input should always deliver an expected output.  

> An expected input always delivers an expected output


To understand more about functional programming, I suggest reading posts by Eric Elliot or looking at [Ramda](https://fr.umio.us/why-ramda/), an open source library full of JavaScript programming utilities written [functionally and in TypeScript](https://ramdajs.com/docs/). [Eric Elliot](https://ericelliottjs.com/) offers so much content on the subject of [functional programming](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/composing-software-the-book-f31c77fc3ddc). 

The code below demonstrated a [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) in functional form. View a [Codepen here](https://codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/eYmqeWo).

```javascript

const link = (tree, item) => [item, tree];

const items = [
  { a: 'a' },
  { b: 'b' },
  { c: 'c' }
];

const linkedList = items.reduceRight(link, []);

console.log(linkedList);

```



## TypeScript, data type checking for JavaScript

[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a computer programming language that compiles to [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). JavaScript can run anywhere—in a web browser, server, etc but is not safely typed. 

With JavaScript, a function as listed below does not require specific types which means that any type of data can be passed into the function.

```javascript

const add = (num, num2) => num + num2

```

Which means that it can be invoked with a `number` data type and `string` data type as arguments even though the function is meant to be invoked with a `number` and a `number`. 

```javascript

add(2, 'hat)

```

With TypeScript, a code editor would catch this potential mistake and the function would be written like so.

```javascript

const add = (num: number, num2: number): number => num + num2

```

The code, written in TypeScript above basically says the the function requires 2 numbers and returns a number. 

## Art

After a trip to Kauai I felt a desire to make art through drawing and painting. Art is something I've long had a passion for. 



## Interpersonal Communication

The nuances of human interaction..

Nervous System Healing
