I decided that I should post an image of Lemonade on Facebook to acknowledge the process of turning lemons into lemonade.</p>
<p>Needless to say - I did not follow through with my promise to post an image of <em>Lemonade</em> on Facebook and this is the story of why.</p>
<p>First, let me preface the story with a brief timeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conversation with my friend,</li>
<li>Planned posting of the Lemonade image until</li>
<li>The incident described below happened.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A gentleman walks by <em>looking down on his luck</em> and says, 'your lucky ... flats can be fixed!'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was in Venice 2 weekends ago working on stuff with the founders of this new clothing company and one of the founders just happened to have this beautiful painting sitting out in their lawn. I took the sec to say, 'Wow! That painting is beautiful!'. Little did I know that this statement would lead to a wild night and early morning!</p>
<p>As I was leaving after a day of <em>data planning</em> the owner of the painting says, 'bet that painting would look great on a wall in your house!'. I agreed and we decided to wrap the painting in cloth &#x26; tie to my car safe and sound ... Right? Wrong! I was driving on the 10 (Los Angeles Area Highway towards Downtown LA (where I currently live) and suddenly <em>Whoosh</em>. The painting was flying through the air. I was initially scared that it was going to cause problems but it landed flat on the front of a semi &#x26; immediately looked to explode.</p>
<p>When I got home, I called the person that had given me the painting &#x26; told him what happened. We sat on opposite ends of the phone silently for a sec. Then he goes, 'Do you remember where on the highway the painting flew off?'. Yup (I knew)! He says, 'Come get me!'. I go and pick him up &#x26; we go searching for the painting on the 10 [again, Los Angeles Highway (always busy)] &#x26; there it is sitting on the side of the Freeway. It might as well have been folded it was so perfect. We pull over &#x26; pick up the painting. As we are driving to the highway exit we hear a <em>whoop whoop whoop</em>. I had a flat tire. One of the wood chips from the painting's frame had lodged itself right into my tire. The tire was flatten almost immediately.</p>
<p>So there we were fixing a flat at about 3am on <em>Crenshaw</em>. Crenshaw is not the safest spot in LA to fix a flat. A gentleman walks by <em>looking down on his luck</em> &#x26; says, 'your lucky ... flats can be fixed!'. He was right. I drove the owner of the painting home &#x26; before we bid our good byes he unfolded the painting &#x26; we looked at it - still beautiful. Art, for the night, lived!</p>
<p>After scrambling to get my car fixed &#x26; other obligations, I didn't have time for the <em>lemonade</em> picture post on Facebook but somehow I hoped that after sharing this story - it doesn't matter. I think that recovering the painting was actually a better symbol &#x26; I hope that my friend feels the same.</p>
