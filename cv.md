## About me
{: .page__title}

## Extra Curricular
{: cv__section-title}

When I’m not working, I try to be an active member of the design & developer community, especially JavaScript. I enjoy teaching what I know & learning as much as possible. I ride road bikes a lot & am a member of [The Rapha Cycling Club](//www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/rcc-public-landing) & [Ritte Cycling Club](//ritte.cc/) in Los Angeles.

As a frontend engineer & user interface specialist, I’m passionate about turning ideas into high performing interfaces for the websites & apps. With a design background, I approach products from conception to quality usable code with an engineering team.
