class="post__section"><div class="post__container"><div class="post__content"><p>Lauren and I met through a mutual friend of ours from Chicago. When she arrived in Manhattan Beach, where I lived, we became fast friends. At the time, I was recovering from a serious bout with Pneumonia. The sickness had left me a bit depressed. She was going through some life changes making us the perfect travel/hang-out duo.</p>
<p>After meeting, we immediately discussed politics and history. Normal stuff, right? ðŸ˜‚ She was passionate about certain things, like Cuba. These certain things she could describe in great detail which I enjoyed listening to for hours. We enjoyed debating certain points. I learned a from her responses.</p>
<p>She had a lot to say about several television shows, like Game of Thrones and Bob&#x27;s Burgers. I know many people watch a lot of television showsâ€”but not like Lauren. She could converse, debate and laugh about each episode of a show she watched in detail. I would watch shows just to connect the dots of the stories Lauren would tell about shows.</p>
<p>The first trip that she roped me into was from Chicago to Orlando in the dead of winter. I don&#x27;t know why she asked me to go but we went. We left Chicago in a blizzard and I remember thinking, &#x27;This is a horrible idea! Why am I doing this?&#x27;. We stopped in Memphis and listened to blues before heading further Southâ€”to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>I remember arriving to the Gulf of Mexico and asking if we could watch the sunset from the Gulf. We went to an old lighthouse. The water was so calm; much more calm than I ever see in the Pacific. Lauren walked to shore facing the sun as it set&gt; She buckled her knees (as she would) and crossed her arms. She looked almost mad at first. Then she took in a deep breath and it seemed that her whole body melted in view. It was the best sunset. At that moment, I was so glad I was on that trip. After, I arriving in Orlando I assumed I wouldn&#x27;t see her again. She had made plans to be a teacher abroad in Doha.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, she reached out with a request to drive to Big Surâ€”a place she had wanted to go to and a favorite place of mine. She came back to California and we drove up the coast staying in Santa Barbara, Monterey, and Morro Bay. It was a memorable trip. Lauren left to teach in Doha after.</p>
<p>Lauren and I would touch base after she moved to Dohaâ€”to reflect on our trips, what was up in our lives and reminisce a bit about fun times we&#x27;d had. She&#x27;d seemed well and that made me happy. I felt like we&#x27;d grown so much together. For myself, I&#x27;d learned how to live my life outside of who I&#x27;d been before Pneumonia. The new me was a bit more accepting of myself and I am thankful for what I learned from Lauren. I felt a stronger desire to just-enjoy-stuff and accept the people I care about for who the are Â·and were.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll never forget Lauren for that and our trips. She will live on in my mind; appreciating sunsetsâ€”accepting a landscape so much that she seems to become a part of it, like that moment at the Gulf of Mexico. She will be missed. I&#x27;ll always see a bit of her in every sunset I watchâ€”its quite good-bye mixed with fiery light. I&#x27;ll miss you Lauren Schlueter.</p>
