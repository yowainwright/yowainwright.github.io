When she arrived in Manhattan Beach, where I lived, we became fast friends. At the time, I was recovering from a serious bout with Pneumonia. The sickness had left me a bit depressed. She was going through some life changes making us the perfect travel/hang-out duo.</p>
<p>After meeting, we immediately discussed politics and history. Normal stuff, right? ðŸ˜‚ She was passionate about certain things, like Cuba. These certain things she could describe in great detail which I enjoyed listening to for hours. We enjoyed debating certain points. I learned a from her responses.</p>
<p>She had a lot to say about several television shows, like Game of Thrones and Bob's Burgers. I know many people watch a lot of television showsâ€”but not like Lauren. She could converse, debate and laugh about each episode of a show she watched in detail. I would watch shows just to connect the dots of the stories Lauren would tell about shows.</p>
<p>The first trip that she roped me into was from Chicago to Orlando in the dead of winter. I don't know why she asked me to go but we went. We left Chicago in a blizzard and I remember thinking, 'This is a horrible idea! Why am I doing this?'. We stopped in Memphis and listened to blues before heading further Southâ€”to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>I remember arriving to the Gulf of Mexico and asking if we could watch the sunset from the Gulf. We went to an old lighthouse. The water was so calm; much more calm than I ever see in the Pacific. Lauren walked to shore facing the sun as it set> She buckled her knees (as she would) and crossed her arms. She looked almost mad at first. Then she took in a deep breath and it seemed that her whole body melted in view. It was the best sunset. At that moment, I was so glad I was on that trip. After, I arriving in Orlando I assumed I wouldn't see her again. She had made plans to be a teacher abroad in Doha.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, she reached out with a request to drive to Big Surâ€”a place she had wanted to go to and a favorite place of mine. She came back to California and we drove up the coast staying in Santa Barbara, Monterey, and Morro Bay. It was a memorable trip. Lauren left to teach in Doha after.</p>
<p>Lauren and I would touch base after she moved to Dohaâ€”to reflect on our trips, what was up in our lives and reminisce a bit about fun times we'd had. She'd seemed well and that made me happy. I felt like we'd grown so much together. For myself, I'd learned how to live my life outside of who I'd been before Pneumonia. The new me was a bit more accepting of myself and I am thankful for what I learned from Lauren. I felt a stronger desire to just-enjoy-stuff and accept the people I care about for who the are Â·and were.</p>
<p>I'll never forget Lauren for that and our trips. She will live on in my mind; appreciating sunsetsâ€”accepting a landscape so much that she seems to become a part of it, like that moment at the Gulf of Mexico. She will be missed. I'll always see a bit of her in every sunset I watchâ€”its quite good-bye mixed with fiery light. I'll miss you Lauren Schlueter.</p></div><div class="post__giscus"></div></div><aside class="aside"><div class="aside__meta"><header class="aside__header"><h3 class="aside__title">Some great memories have Lauren in the foreground</h3></header><section class="share"><nav class="share__nav"><button class="share__button">Share Article Link</button></nav></section></div></aside></section></article><footer class="site-footer" role="contentinfo" itemType="http://schema.org/WPFooter"><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--main"><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--contact"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Contact</h3><address class="site-footer__address"><p class="site-footer__content">Happy to chat, learn, help!</p><p class="site-footer__content"><a href="mailto:yowainwright@gmail.com">yowainwright@gmail.com</a>, Los Angeles, CA</p></address></article><div class="site-footer__col site-footer__col site-footer__col--social"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Connect</h3><nav class="social-footer"><ul class="social-list"><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://github.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Github</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://instagram.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Instragram</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrywainwright/" class="social-list__link">LinkedIn</a></li></ul></nav></div><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--self"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--self">About</h3><figure class="site-footer__figure"><img class="media--circular site-footer__image" src="https://yowainwright.imgix.net/portraits/me-smiling.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Me smiling with a beard"/><figcaption class="site-footer__caption"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/"><strong>jeffry.in</strong>, <!-- -->2025</a>, is the blog of<!-- --> <a class="site-footer__link" href="/about">Jeffry (Jeff) Wainwright</a>, a software engineer, person, living in Los Angeles.</figcaption></figure></article></section><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--last"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--last"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/">jeffry.in</a>, <!-- -->2025</h3></section></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Some great memories have Lauren in the foreground","meta":"Recently, I lost a friend.
