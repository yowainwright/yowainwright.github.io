**From Instagram:** My two favorite peaks in Angeles Forest, Mt Disappointment & Mt Deception, have interesting literal historiesâ€”their naming is the result of a mistake. Despite their mislabelling, they stand; formidable & beautiful. On the day of this photo, because of fog and snow, all signs of humanity were lost yet the mountains remained solid. Labels don't mean much to mountains. I want to be like a mountain!
