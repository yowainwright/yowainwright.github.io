  living in Los Angeles.
---

As a Software Engineer, I specialize in maintainable software applications & build pipelines. I love getting things to work & then making them work better! With 15+ years of start-up & corporate engineering, I have technical ability ranging from design, to engineering management to—just-a-little DevOps. I've written a lot of open source with a utility focus because I enjoy making the “squeaky wheel” spin! I seek roles where learning is must, there are problems to solve, & I can feel good about creating products that hopefully make people happier.
