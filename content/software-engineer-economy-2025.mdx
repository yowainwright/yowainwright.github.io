## TL;DR

For several months I've been wondering if I could draw parallels between US Software Engineering jobs now and US manufacturing jobs starting in the 1970's.<InlineSource url="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-9/forty-years-of-falling-manufacturing-employment.htm">BLS</InlineSource>.
And so I did.

### After research, I found parallels worth sharing

US software engineering employment peaked November 2019—the decline started before AI, before the pandemic<InlineSource url="https://www.adpresearch.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-software-developer/">ADP Research</InlineSource>.
Job postings are down 35% from 5 years ago<InlineSource url="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE">FRED/Indeed</InlineSource>,
entry-level jobs down 50% in Big Tech<InlineSource url="https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/decrease-in-entry-level-tech-jobs">Eng Leadership</InlineSource>.
Meanwhile, Software Engineering in Asia grew +350%<InlineSource url="https://www.griddynamics.com/blog/number-software-developers-world">Grid Dynamics</InlineSource> and 168% in Eastern Europe<InlineSource url="https://dealroom.co/guides/the-state-of-european-tech">Dealroom</InlineSource>.

<RiseAndFallChart />

US manufacturing peaked in 1979.
It's been declining for 45 years.
Software engineering peaked in 2019.
The trajectory is starting to look familiar.

## A Good Life

I grew up near Lead, South Dakota in the 1980s. My dad worked for Homestake Mine.
In the early 1990s, people still said "you could always work at the mine."
It was stable, well-paying work—$38,000 per year<InlineSource url="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/1995/report-details-mining-industrys-impact-on-south-dakotas-economy">1</InlineSource>, double the South Dakota state average.
Lead had a population of about 3,000. The mine employed 2,200.
If you worked there, you could buy a house, save for retirement, and even send your kids to college.
This was how I grew up.

Then Homestake's slow decline began.
First, 200 jobs eliminated during<InlineSource url="https://republicofmining.com/2015/05/06/homestake-mining-company-history-1877-2000/">2</InlineSource>.
Most workers didn't panic. January 1998: 400 more jobs lost, underground operations ceased. Gold prices fell to $253/ounce in July 1999—lowest in 20 years. September 2000: shutdown announced. December 2001: Homestake closed entirely. All 2,200 jobs gone.<InlineSource url="https://www.blackhillsknowledgenetwork.org/home/in-history-homestake-announces-shutdown-of-lead-mine.html">4</InlineSource>. It was slow. Each year felt manageable—just a little worse than the last.
which didn't feel like a disaster then. This same pattern has played out across the US.
The stories have become mundane in their commonality, yet they mean tens of millions of Americans quietly have less.
As a software engineer, I've had an itching feeling something similar is going now in tech to what I experienced as a kid with manufacturing.

## Are US-based Software Engineers Next?

For ~3 years, I've wondered if software engineers are experiencing the same pattern.
My teammates dismiss it: "It's AI." "It's the economy." "It's inflation." And, I've wanted to believe them.
After switching jobs in June 2024, watching mass layoffs, and seeing AI adoption explode, I really had to look at some data from the perspective of where I grew up.

### What's Happening to Software Engineers in the US

I keep thinking about manufacturing. Companies chased cheaper labor, framed it as efficiency, and hollowed themselves out in the process. There's nothing wrong with global talent or competitive markets—but there's a difference between finding the best people and finding the cheapest rate. The data suggests that line is getting thin.

Developer employment peaked in November 2019—then started falling<InlineSource url="https://www.adpresearch.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-software-developer/">ADP Research</InlineSource>.
The decline accelerated in 2022 and 2023, but it started before the pandemic.
428,000+ tech workers were laid off in 2022-2023 combined, with software engineers making up 22% of layoffs<InlineSource url="https://365datascience.com/trending/who-was-affected-by-the-2022-2023-tech-layoffs/">365 Data Science</InlineSource>

Software engineer job postings in the US are down **-35%** vs 5 years ago<InlineSource url="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE">FRED/Indeed</InlineSource>
Current postings are **3.5x lower** than the 2022 peak<InlineSource url="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/">Pragmatic Engineer</InlineSource>
Specialized roles (Android, Java, iOS, .NET) are also **-60%+**<InlineSource url="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/state-of-the-tech-market-in-2025">Pragmatic Engineer</InlineSource>
The decline started before AI tools went mainstream.
But this trend was going on before ChatGPT and tech layoffs making headlines.

#### 2. Offshore Engineering: Exploding

<GlobalGrowthChart />

Asia grew +350% (2015-2023)<InlineSource url="https://www.griddynamics.com/blog/number-software-developers-world">7a</InlineSource>, Eastern Europe +168%<InlineSource url="https://dealroom.co/guides/the-state-of-european-tech">7e</InlineSource>, while the US stayed flat. The work isn't disappearing—it's moving. Companies are expanding globally while contracting domestically. This is the same pattern manufacturing experienced: jobs shift to regions with lower labor costs while domestic employment declines.

### Why This Pattern Is Hard to See

The decline happens slowly—2-3% per year, not 20% overnight. Nominal salaries still look high ($165k in SF sounds great until you price a one-bedroom).

A large portion of domestic software engineers didn't grow up watching factories close or mines shut down. We don't have the reference point that manufacturing workers' families had. The pattern is the same, but we haven't seen it before.

### Who's Getting Squeezed Hardest?

{/* @TODO: refine - closer but needs polish; add AI stat minimally (92% use AI tools); add record profits data (Big 5 $327B profit +25.6% while cutting 42K jobs) */}
Entry-level US jobs at large tech companies are down<InlineSource url="https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/decrease-in-entry-level-tech-jobs">Eng Leadership</InlineSource>. CS graduate unemployment hit 6.1%—nearly double philosophy majors which sharply contrasts general advice from leadership<InlineSource url="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/computer-science-graduates-face-worst-job-market-in-decades">Final Round AI</InlineSource>. Experienced engineers are seeing layoffs as well despite capability or talent<InlineSource url="https://x.com/rbuckton/status/1922364558426911039">X</InlineSource>. It appears to be a part of a multi-tiered effort to decrease costs<InlineSource url="https://www.levels.fyi/2024/">Levels.fyi</InlineSource> but, based on previous history, it comes with a cost to both company and country innovation and economic well-being.

### The Hiring Process Has Shifted

Power has moved from candidates to employers. Teams now interview 40% more candidates per hire than in 2021<InlineSource url="https://www.ashbyhq.com/talent-trends-report/reports/2023-recruiter-productivity-trends-report">Ashby</InlineSource>, and 81% of hiring managers report decision-making paralysis<InlineSource url="https://blog.theinterviewguys.com/state-of-the-hiring-process-in-2025/">Interview Guys</InlineSource>. When supply exceeds demand, candidates compete for companies.

### The Contractor Shift

Large tech companies are increasing their percentage of contractors<InlineSource url="https://www.index.dev/blog/why-big-tech-companies-hire-contractors">Index.dev</InlineSource>. Shifting from core employees to contractors to offshoring appears to follow a playbook established by US manufacturing in the 1970s<InlineSource url="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/book-review/the-temp-economy.htm">BLS</InlineSource>.

## Comparing the Numbers

Here's how manufacturing declines looked at year 5:

**At year 5 in their declines:**
- GM (1984): -24% employment, -4% wages
- Bethlehem Steel (1980): -17% employment, -3% wages
- Homestake (1985): -16% employment, -2% wages

**Software engineering (2024, year 5 since 2019 peak):**
- Job postings: -35% from 2019, -71% from 2022 peak
- Pay growth: lagging US workers by 6 percentage points

Different metrics, but the direction is the same.

### Executive vs Engineer Compensation

CEO compensation grew 34.7% (2019-2024) while engineering real wages fell 7%<InlineSource url="https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2023/">EPI</InlineSource><InlineSource url="https://www.levels.fyi/2024/">Levels.fyi</InlineSource>. The CEO-to-worker pay ratio reached 281:1.

### Manual Laborers Have Been Experiencing This Since 1975

Manual laborers have been experiencing wage stagnation since 1975. White-collar workers since the 1990s. Software engineers are just now joining them.

<WageStagnationChart />

Production workers' real wages are down 9% since 1975. White-collar workers are up only 2%—essentially flat for 50 years. Software engineers are up 80% since 1975, but down 5% since 2015.

{/* @TODO: rewrite - reads like a listicle */}
Manual laborers recognize this pattern: "efficiency tools" arrive, productivity narratives follow, workforce reductions come next, hours increase for survivors, and wage stagnation sets in. Manufacturing experienced this from 1975-2010—employment fell 33%, real wages fell 9%, and productivity gains went to ownership.

If you grew up watching a parent work in a factory or warehouse, the current tech environment feels familiar. If your parents were knowledge workers who saw steady growth through the 1990s-2000s, this decline feels new. Different engineers have different reference points for recognizing the pattern.

## When Workers Were Valued

<IndustrialRevolutionChart />

{/* @TODO: rewrite - management book language */}
From 1820-1880, real wages stayed flat for 60 years while productivity soared. From 1880-1920, that changed—wages surged 60%, hours dropped from 72/week to 44/week. What shifted? Companies that invested in workers outperformed those that didn't. The data from that era is clear: treating workers as assets, not costs, built stronger companies and stronger communities.

---

## Conclusion

I started this research wondering if what I was feeling was real or just my perception. After looking at the data, I found patterns that surprised me.

At year 5 since their peaks: software engineering has job postings down 35%, pay growth lagging by 6 points. GM (1984) was at -24% employment, -4% wages. Bethlehem Steel (1980) at -17% employment, -3% wages. Homestake (1985) at -16% employment, -2% wages. The patterns rhyme.

{/* @TODO: rewrite - last sentence sounds like me */}
What happened next? GM declined 85% over 30 years and needed a government bailout. Bethlehem Steel went bankrupt. Cutting workers was framed as efficiency. The data suggests it was a symptom of decline, not a path to growth.

I watched my dad's workplace go from 2,200 jobs to zero. Each year felt manageable. By the time the pattern was clear, it was too late.

I could be wrong about what this data means. But the numbers are there, and I think they're worth discussing. If you see something I've missed, please reach out.
