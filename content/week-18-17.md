This week I wrapped up work on a variance issue with an analytics tool. Outside of work I was still dealing an ankle injury. I combated these things by heading up to visit my sister for her birthday. My sister has recently been up in Northwestern United States—a great place to enjoy the moody weather and lots of coffee.
