The 5th week post is coming a week late. There were negotiations going on and I built a major analytics update for the site that I'm been working on. Outside of tech, I had some good runs and spent some time at Leo Carrillo Beach.

## Updating Analytics

Analytics for the site I'm working on had a straightforward facelift. Or teams are also working on tool to make analytics more uniform across our web properties.

## Fitness Work

I wasn't able to surf as much because of continued rain. I made it to the rock gym a few times and my apartment gym a few more times. I got onto my bike and ran for a few [hours](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201705&interval_type=week&chart_type=miles&year_offset=0) as well.

## Leo Carrillo State Beach

Driving by Leo Carrillo State Beach on Highway 1 has always been enjoyable. There's a rock that juts out from the ocean and appears to be battling longboarder waves 24 hours a day. Also, if there's been any rain, a stream flows out into the ocean. These are nice features of a beach. I had never really explored the beach beyond these observations though. I did that this week. Just north of the rocks and stream that is observable from highway are a few rock caves. The whole scene—the waves, the stream and the rock cave are memorable. I'm very glad I went.
