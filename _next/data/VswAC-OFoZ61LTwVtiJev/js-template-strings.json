Where some ES6 featuring can get ugly at build time, I've found that ES6 strings are very powerful.\n\nStrings with dynamic data used to be structured something like this:\n\n```javascript\n\nvar someData = 'this is some data' + someVar + 'some other data';\n\n```\n\nWith ES6, we can write strings much more cleanly:\n\n```javaScript\n\nconst someData = `this is some data ${someVar} some other data`;\n\n```\n\nTo me this is much more clear and I've found when transpiling code, the end result is as expected _most_ every time.\n\n## But wait, there's more\n\nAfter watching [ES6 for Everyone](//es6.io/) by [Wes Bos](//wesbos.com/) I learned more about template tagging.\n\n###  Template Tagging\n\nTemplate tagging makes template strings more dynamic.\n\nThe example below iterates over a string and an undefined number of values (using the [spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) operator) within a string until the the string is a static value.\n\n```javaScript\n\nfunction addCustomName(stings, ...values) {\n  let str = '';\n  strings.forEach((string, i) => {\n    str += string + (values[i] || '');\n  });\n}\n\nconst fullName = addCustomName`Hi, my name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`;\nconsole.log(fullName);\n\n```\n\n## ES6 Templates Notes Conclusion\n\nAfter watching ES6 for everyone, the course re-affirmed information about Template Strings and Tagging. The course's careful description and examples of template tagging offered a much clearer its utility. ~Thanks\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
