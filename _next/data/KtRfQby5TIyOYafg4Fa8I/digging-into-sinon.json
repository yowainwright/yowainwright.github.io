The library and concept have confused me several times. I've found defining the interface to be challenging. Often, I realize that if the interface is challenging me, I need to rethink it.\n\nIn this post, I will explain a bit of Sinon for context and then dig into faking a server with Sinon.\n\n---\n\n- Stubbing, in JavaScript, is the act of making a dummy function that acts like a real JavaScript Interface allowing the stubber to fully test the thing they're testing. In example, if your testing a method that gets `.user()` information\n- Interface, in regards to this post, is the way information is passed, changed, published between methods and functions. If information interface is not optimal, tests should be able to show that.\n\n#### For this post, here's a stub example\n\n```javascript\nlet server\n// then later in code a value is assigned to the variable\nserver = sinon.fakeServer.create()\n```\n\n## Why would developers stub a server?\n\nEngineers stub servers so that they can make fake requests to stubbed servers. The benefit of doing this is that the engineer doesn't need a real server and because they're not dependent on a real server, they can focus on testing whatever their code does that needs a server to test it.\n\n## A specific example\n\nIn the example below, an ajax request is being made with plain ole' JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nexport default function getUser(url, callbackInfo) {\n  let info = {\n    stuff: null,\n  }\n  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  xhr.open('GET', url, true)\n  xhr.withCredentials = true\n  // update `info` onload\n  xhr.addEventListener('load', () => {\n    if (xhr.status > 400) {\n      console.warn('Some Warning')\n      callbackInfo(info)\n      return\n    }\n    const resp = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)\n    const respinfo = resp.info || null\n    if (respinfo === null) return\n\n    // update info\n    info = {\n      stuff: respinfo.status || null,\n    }\n    callbackInfo(info)\n  })\n\n  xhr.addEventListener('error', () => {\n    console.warn('Some Warning')\n    callbackInfo(info)\n  })\n\n  xhr.send()\n}\n```\n\nFor the code example above, there is an interface that expects to get information from an ajax request and provide information in responseâ€”a response being what comes back from the server.\n\n## How to stub a server with Sinon\n\nIn the example above:\n\n- The xhr request waits for a load event.\n- If the response in above a 400, that means there is an error with the response, and the console should warn developers.\n- If the response is not above a 400, the request will receive a `{object}` with a `status`.\n- In a callback function, the xhr request will return the object `{info}`.\n- If there is an `error` instead of a load event, another warning should be added to the console.\n\nNo, that there is an example and a bullet list of what's happening, Sinon can be used to stub a fake server so we can mock the scenarios of the function.\n\nTo do this, first, a stub server must be created.\n\n```javascript\nserver = sinon.fakeServer.create()\n```\n\nIt is beneficial to mock a successful API response\n\n```javascript\n// fake api\nconst resp = '{\"info\": \"stuff\"}'\n```\n\nNext, describe what the fake server should response with. This is done with a method provided by Sinon and arguments.\n\n```javascript\nserver.respondWith(url, resp)\n```\n\nSinon's `respondWith` method is _what the server responds with_. It can take in 3 arguments, a method (function), a URL or part of a URL, and the anticipated response. The documentation leaves what the method can do a mistery so this blog post will just stick to what's clear: the URL, and the response. When the `respondWith` method is left to that stubbing out the rest of the fake server response is just a few steps.\n\nThe final step is, triggering the fake response.\n\n```javascript\nserver.respond()\n```\n\nAltogether the stubbed server looks like this.\n\n```javascript\n// define fake api success reponse\nconst resp = '{\"info\": \"stuff\"}'\n// create the fake server\nserver = sinon.fakeServer.create()\n// declare what the fake server should respond with\nserver.respondWith(url, resp)\n// declare the fake response\n```\n\n## How to fully test a stubbed Sinon server\n\nNow that this post has gone through stubbing a Sinon server, it will go into how the stub can be used to test the three things that the example function above will require.\n\n- Test a successful response\n- Test a failed response\n- Test a errant response\n\n### Testing a successful response\n\n```javascript\n// this post reference Mocha testing\nit('provides `user` information with request success', function(done) {\n  // the done argument along with this.timeout acts waits for a response for 100ms\n  this.timeout(100)\n  // create the fake Sinon server\n  server = sinon.fakeServer.create()\n  // define the end point and its response within args\n  server.respondWith(url, resp)\n  getUser(url, function info(user) {\n    // define user interface\n    expect(user).to.be.an('Object')\n    expect(user.accountStatus === 'registered').to.be.true\n    expect(user.loginState === 'semi').to.be.true\n    expect(user.memberType === '146216164134017374').to.be.true\n    expect(user.userID === '75607431722225').to.be.true\n    done()\n  })\n  // invoke the fake Sinon server response\n  server.respond()\n})\n```\n\n### Testing a failed response\n\n```javascript\nit('provides `user` information with request success', () => {\n  // create the fake Sinon server\n  server = sinon.fakeServer.create({ respondImmediately: true })\n  // because the server response immediately, invoking the response is not needed\n  server.respondWith('/test', resp)\n  getUser(url, function info(user) {\n    // define a null user interface\n    expect(user).to.be.an('Object')\n    expect(user.accountStatus).to.be.null\n    expect(user.loginState).to.be.null\n    expect(user.memberType).to.be.null\n    expect(user.userID).to.be.null\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### Testing an errant response\n\n```javascript\nit('provides null defaults with `user` request error', function() {\n  // invoke server immediately to enforce error response\n  server = sinon.fakeServer.create({ respondImmediately: true })\n  server.respondWith('/test', resp, [404, {}, ''])\n  getUser(url, function info(user) {\n    // define null user interface\n    expect(user).to.be.an('Object')\n    expect(user.accountStatus).to.be.null\n    expect(user.loginState).to.be.null\n    expect(user.memberType).to.be.null\n    expect(user.userID).to.be.null\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis post has described how to use Sinon's Fake Server to fully test an interface for an XHR request. XHR Requests can be mocked by Sinon easily with a general understanding of Sinon. After setting up a Mock that works for a product, similar tests can be copied and reused elsewhere. This is why Sinon's Fake Server is a powerful tool.\n\nPlease use Sinon and [Sinon's Fake Server](http://sinonjs.org/releases/v2.1.0/fake-xhr-and-server/).
