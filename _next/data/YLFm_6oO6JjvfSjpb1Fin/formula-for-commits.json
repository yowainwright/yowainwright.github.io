It is equally easy to reach the agreement that most commit messages are not good. In this post, AWW, a formula for writing basic meaningful commit messages, will be discussed.</p>\n<h2>3 Things Meaningful Commit Messages Should Have</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>action</strong>: this word is a verb that describes what the commit does</li>\n<li><strong>what</strong>: word(s) that describe what the <em>action</em> is relative to</li>\n<li><strong>where</strong>: word(s) that describe <em>where</em> the <em>action</em> is happening to <em>what</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is called <strong>AWW</strong> which sounds cute, so I like it.</p>\n<p>Here's a git terminal example:</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes theme-custom-light theme-custom-dark\" style=\"background-color:#f9f9f9;--shiki-dark-bg:#031030;color:#000000;--shiki-dark:#b3d8e5\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E2657E;--shiki-dark:#E2657E\">git</span><span style=\"color:#007CF0;--shiki-dark:#007CF0\"> commit</span><span style=\"color:#E2657E;--shiki-dark:#E2657E\"> -m</span><span style=\"color:#007CF0;--shiki-dark:#007CF0\"> 'changes `dataObj.id` in the `dataObj`'</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>In the example above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>action</strong> is the word 'changes'</li>\n<li><strong>what</strong> is <code>dataObj.id</code></li>\n<li><strong>where</strong> is 'in the <code>dataObj</code>'</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why make a formula?</h2>\n<p>Git messages are important. They seem simple to write in discussion. When changing multiple files or things in a file, the meaning of changes can be lost easily. Following the AWW formula helps composing meaning when committing.</p>","slug":"formula-for-commits"},"__N_SSG":true}
