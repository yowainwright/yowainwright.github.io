Why did I learn how I could replace it?_\n\n---\n\nOver the past 2 years, my beloved tool for updating dependencies seems to be focused on other features, like [security alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates), or has abandoned features I used every day, like it's [Github app](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps) and [app](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112034046/http://dependabot.com/) interfaces. At the very least, it hasn't provided easy ways to update dependencies for 2 features which are fairly standard for JavaScript developmentâ€”[pnpm](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1736) and [monorepos](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/4993).\n\n## Wait! What is Dependabot?\n\n_Well, first off. This post is written from the context of code, using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and using code libraries which excel the capability of code. If this is not clear or of interest to you, stop reading now!_\n\n---\n\nDependabot is tool for managing coding project dependencies that are maintained in a git service. Mainly Github. This is important for security and keeping code up to date! Dependabot does this using [release, cron, or other events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) which are performed by git management tools (Github for this post). When a git management tool event triggers Dependabot to update dependencies, Dependabot does this specked to a [yml file configuration](https://github.com/yowainwright/mini-cookies/blob/master/.github/dependabot.yml), where is runs update commands and will create an [update pull request](https://github.com/yowainwright/mini-cookies/pull/95) if there are updates.\n\n## How Can We Make Our Own Dependabot?\n\nIn the paragraph above, I mentioned how Dependabot works. It perfects tasks based on git management events. The cool thing is we can use those events tooâ€”just like Dependabot.\n\n### 1. Create an action that is triggered by a Git event\n\nTo build our own Dependabot in 5 mins, let's use cron and a github action like so:\n\n```yml\nname: update dependencies\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # This will run at 5am on Monday's\n    - cron:  '0 5 * * 1'\n    # The cron reference below is for every 5 minutes (useful for debugging)\n    # - cron: '*/5 * * * *'\n```\n\n_Cool. Now we are using a Github Action to run a cron job in a time range that we control!_\n\n### 2. Run a script to update our dependencies\n\nNext up, we'll want to update our dependencies. For this I'm using pnpmâ€”but npm and yarn work the same. _Use what you like!_\n\n> ### All JavaScript package managers have update commands that can be run to update dependencies!\n\n```yml\n  ...\n  steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2.2.2\n        with:\n          version: latest\n      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n          cache: 'pnpm'\n      - run: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile\n      - run: pnpm update\n```\n\n### 3. Finally, we should create a pull request with our updates\n\nLastly, we'll want to create a PR with our updates. For this, the fastest way is using [Peter Evans](https://github.com/peter-evans) [Create Pull Request Action](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request).\n\n> You could build this yourself using the Github API. You can also replicate this functionality using the [GH cli](https://cli.github.com/) but that will take a bit more than 5 minutes.\n\n```yml\n    ...\n    - name: Create Pull Request\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4\n        with:\n            token: ${{ secrets.PR_CREATE_TOKEN }}\n            commit-message: Update dependencies\n            title: \"[dependencies]  update dependencies\"\n            body: |\n              ## Dependency updates\n              Auto-generated using [create-pull-request][2]\n              [1]: https://github.com/<org/user name>/<repo name>\n              [2]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request\n            branch: update-dependencies\n```\n\n---\n\nQuick note: You'll notice there is a required token in order to be able to create a pull request. That might be another post but [here's a link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for now!\n\n---\n\n### Here's a summary (aka all the yml)\n\n```yml\nname: update dependencies\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron:  '0 5 * * 1'\n    # - cron: '*/5 * * * *'\n\njobs:\n  udpate-deps:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        node-version: [16.x]\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2.2.2\n        with:\n          version: latest\n      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n          cache: 'pnpm'\n      - run: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile\n      - run: pnpm update\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4\n        with:\n            token: ${{ secrets.PR_CREATE_TOKEN }}\n            commit-message: Update dependencies\n            title: \"update dependencies\"\n            body: |\n              ## Dependency updates\n              [1]: https://github.com/<org/user name>/<repo name>\n              [2]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request\n            branch: update-dependencies\n```\n\n---\n\n_This post is in progress!
