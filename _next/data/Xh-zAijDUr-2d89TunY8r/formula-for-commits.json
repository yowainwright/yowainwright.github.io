It is equally easy to reach the agreement that most commit messages are not good. In this post, AWW, a formula for writing basic meaningful commit messages, will be discussed.\n\n## 3 Things Meaningful Commit Messages Should Have\n\n-  **action**: this word is a verb that describes what the commit does\n-  **what**: word(s) that describe what the _action_ is relative to\n-  **where**: word(s) that describe _where_ the _action_ is happening to _what_\n\nThis is called **AWW** which sounds cute, so I like it.\n\nHere's a git terminal example:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m 'changes `dataObj.id` in the `dataObj`'\n```\n\nIn the example above:\n-  **action** is the word 'changes'\n-  **what** is `dataObj.id`\n-  **where** is 'in the `dataObj`'\n\n## Why make a formula?\n\nGit messages are important. They seem simple to write in discussion. When changing multiple files or things in a file, the meaning of changes can be lost easily. Following the AWW formula helps composing meaning when committing.\n","slug":"formula-for-commits"},"__N_SSG":true}
