When clicking on the email share, customers were being shown an alert box.\n\nOn desktop devices, there was no issue.\n\nAfter going through various debugging techniques, I noticed 2 things that may help other developers out:\n\n-  Make sure that there is no target attribute on the email share link. This is what initiates alerts on mobile devices.\n-  When debugging errors with email share links on Device Simulators, remember that simulators like the IOS Simulator don't have email clients installed initially.\n\nHere's a code sample of something that works:\n\n```html\n  <a href=\"mailto:?subject={{articleTitle}}&amp;body={{articleLink}}\" data-track-share=\"Email\" data-track-slug=\"{{articleLink}}\" class=\"share__link share__link--mail js-share-mail js-share-event\" title=\"Email\">Share</a>\n```\n","slug":"email-share-link"},"__N_SSG":true}
