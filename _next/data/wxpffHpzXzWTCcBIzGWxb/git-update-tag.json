They usually use [Semver Versioning](http://semver.org/).\n\nBecause tags often specify specific changes in code, sometimes updates need to be added to specific tags. This update can be made in a few simple steps.\n\nEstablish tags\n\n```bash\ngit tag\n```\n\nDelete tag\n\n```bash\ngit push origin :refs/tags/[tag version]\n```\n\nFinally, re-create the tag by following your initial steps for setting up git tags.\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
