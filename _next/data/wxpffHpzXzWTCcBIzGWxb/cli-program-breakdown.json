The `name` of the CLI\n2. THe `arguments` it takes\n3. The `options` it takes\n\nThis is what it looks like to run a CLI command\n\n```bash\n<name> <argument> --<option> <optional-option-input> --<option>\n# note: if an option is passed in without an option input, it will be interpreted as a boolean\n```\n\nThe invisible but most important part of a CLI command is its action.\nThe CLI command action is a function that get invoked when a CLI command is executed.\nActions take in CLI command `arguments` and/or `options` as function arguments.\n\nLet's explore the parts of a CLI command more below!\n\n## Name\n\nCLI commands always have a name! By entering in only a CLI's name, if a CLI is defined, it should execute.\n\n```bash\n$ <cli-name>\n# ie => npm\n# executes a log listing of npm commands\n```\n\n## Arguments\n\nArguments are keywords passed into a CLI to define how the CLI should be run.\nArguments are required parameters.\n\n```bash\n$ <cli-name> <cli-argument>\n# ie => npm init\n# prompts to setup a `package.json` file\n```\n\n## Options\n\nOptions are optional arguments that can be passed into a CLI.\nOptions are optional parameters.\n\n```bash\n$ <cli-name> <cli-argument> --<option> <optional-option-input>\n# ie => npm install --save-dev lodash\n# installs lodash as a dev dependency\n```\n\n```bash\n$ <cli-name> <cli-argument> --<option>\n# ie => npm install --frozen-lockfile\n# installs the frozen lockfile\n```\n\n## Actions\n\nActions consist of the code that is executed when a CLI is run.\nActions are functions which take in the CLIs arguments and options which define how the CLI should be run.\n\nHere's an example of CLI command with its action above it:\n\n```typescript\n!/usr/bin/env node\n// ^ Used to specify how the file is to be executed\n\nconst { program } = require(\"commander\");\nconst { version } = require(\"../package.json\");\nconst { script } = require(\"./script\");\nimport { Options } from \"./types\";\n\n/**\n * action\n * @param {Options} options\n */\nasync function action(options: Options = {}) {\n  const { config } = options;\n  const urls = options?.urls || config?.urls || [];\n  script({ urls });\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version(version)\n  .description(\"list all script tag srcs on a webpage from a given url\")\n  .option(\"-u, --urls [urls...]\", \"urls of script sources\")\n  .option(\"-c, --config <config>\", \"config file to use\")\n  .action(action)\n  .parse(process.argv);\n```\n\n## Some nuances of CLI commands\n\nWhile writing this blog post, I realized there were some subtle nuances that might be useful to clarify regarding CLI command arguments.\n\nIn example, with popular npm CLI:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n# installs all dependencies\n```\n\nWhile\n\n```bash\n$ npm install lodash --save-dev\n# installs lodash as a dev dependency\n```\n\nBut\n\n```bash\n$ npm install lodash\n# only installs all previously installed dependencies (not lodash!)\n```\n\nThis is because the command above doesn't have the `--save-dev` or `--save` boolean argument to declare where the `lodash` dependency should be installed!\nThe CLI command, therefore, reads to the computer what it can readâ€”aka `npm install`!\n\nThis is _really_ confusing but the general principle remains the same.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nTaking the time to understand the basic parts of a CLI command is powerful thing keep in mind.\nMost things done with code are accompanied by CLI commands to optimize their use.\nBy being able to leverage and understand CLI commands, users can traverse across many technical landscapes and programming language.\n\n---\n\nI've written several CLIs for various jobs. My most used open source CLI is [es-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-check).\nI still have a lot to learn so please reach out if you observe something I've written that could be improved.\n\nHappy Hacking!\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
