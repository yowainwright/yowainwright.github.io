It provides a better API for the majority of its customers. Most of the issues that Stickybits was getting on Github revolved around Stickybits customers wanting to be able to make the API work for them. In example, customers wanted to be able to change CSS class names or only add the styles that they need for Stickybits to work. Stickybits 2._ provides that!

I've had issues with my ankles for the last months. After only riding bikes and surfing, running again saves time and is great for cross-training. While visiting friends in Ventura, I was able to enjoy trail runs East of Ventura. In the next weeks, I will be releasing some starters repos for new web productsâ€”like nuxt, ember, and tentatively, Gatsby.</p>","slug":"week-34-17"},"__N_SSG":true}
