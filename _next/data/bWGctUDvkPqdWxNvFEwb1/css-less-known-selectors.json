This can be useful if you're trying to select something that has been concatenated into a data attribute.\n\n## Contains (text)\n\nThe **Container (text)** css selector uses the `~` or approx and will select an element that has the defined text in an attribute.\n\n**Example**\n\n```html\n<a title=\"some special text\">something</a>\n<a title=\"text\"></a>\n```\n\n```css\na[href~=\"text\"] {\n    background: yellow;\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above the first `<a>`, or anchor tag would have a green background & the second `<a>` would have no background.\nThis can be useful if you're trying to select something that has specific word in a title attribute.\n\n## Summation\n\nThese selectors are powerful; especially when you have to select 3rd party content (content that may or may not be on a page).\n","slug":"css-less-known-selectors"},"__N_SSG":true}
