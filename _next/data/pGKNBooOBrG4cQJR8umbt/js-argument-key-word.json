The process of describing what's happening in a program I find highly beneficial. As I was talking through the program I noticed the `[argument](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)` key word.\n\nThe `argument` key word is an object that stores the arguments passed into a function within the scope of that function.\n\n```javascript\nvar passArguments = function() {\n  return document.write(arguments.length);\n};\npassArguments(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n// result: the document prints out 5\n```\n\nLive [Code](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/2f64d380b74302b396927d297828cd3a)\n\nFor the program that I was working on today, the program takes the first argument of the function `passArguments` as stores it in a variable set as category. Then it loops through the other arguments & strong them in the logs array.\n\n```javascript\nvar passArguments = function() {\n\tvar category = arguments[0];\n\tlogs = new Array( arguments.length - 1 );\n\tfor (var i = 0, j = logs.length; i < j; i++) {\n\t  logs[i] = arguments[i+1];\n\t}\n\tdocument.write(category + ' : ' + '[' + logs + ']' );\n};\npassArguments('Categories', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5');\n```\n\nLive [Code](//codepen.io/yowainwright/pen/6b24e79b8dcd00668619acd396dd4b46)\n\nWhile my boss & I were going over the program, he wrote out the code similarly to how a browser compiles it.\n\n```javascript\narguments = ['ga', 'info a', 'info b', 'info c']\narguments = ['ga', 'info a', 'info b', 'info c']\n\ncategory = 'ga';\nlogs = [ , , ]\n\nfor loop\nstart at: 0\ngo to: 3\n\nfor loop 1( i = 0)\nlogs[0] = 'info a'\nlogs = [ 'info a', , ]\n\nfor loop 2 (i = 1)\nlogs = [ 'info a', 'info b', ]\n\nfor loop 3\nlogs = [ 'info a', 'info b', 'info c']\n\nend for loop\n```\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
