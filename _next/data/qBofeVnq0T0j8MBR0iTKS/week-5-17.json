There were negotiations going on and I built a major analytics update for the site that I'm been working on.

I made it to the rock gym a few times and my apartment gym a few more times. I got onto my bike and ran for a few <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201705&#x26;interval_type=week&#x26;chart_type=miles&#x26;year_offset=0\">hours</a> as well.</p>\n<h2>Leo Carrillo State Beach</h2>\n<p>Driving by Leo Carrillo State Beach on Highway 1 has always been enjoyable. There's a rock that juts out from the ocean and appears to be battling longboarder waves 24 hours a day. Also, if there's been any rain, a stream flows out into the ocean. These are nice features of a beach. I had never really explored the beach beyond these observations though. I did that this week. Just north of the rocks and stream that is observable from highway are a few rock caves. The whole scene—the waves, the stream and the rock cave are memorable. I'm very glad I went.</p>","slug":"week-5-17"},"__N_SSG":true}
