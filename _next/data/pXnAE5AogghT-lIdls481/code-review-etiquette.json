Code Review Etiquette affects learning, code quality, relationships, and self-confidence. Code is logical in nature. It is easy to pinpoint code that is incorrect or could be improved. The human condition when looking at and discussing logical things (like code) can disregard feelings of other people. This causes feelings get hurt and loss of focus on learning and collaboration. This post boils down general feelings mixed with suggestions to improve <strong>Code Review Etiquette</strong>.</p>\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://www.mindpodnetwork.com/albert-einstein-rabindranath-tagore-discuss-music/\">\n    <img src=\"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/code-review-etiquette/einstein-tagore.jpg\" alt=\"Einstein and Tagore meet to discuss music\">\n  </a>\n  <figcaption>Albert Einstein and Rabindranath Tagare discussing music, July 4th, 1930. Image from <a href=\"https://www.mindpodnetwork.com/\">Mind Pod Network</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Improving Code Review Etiquette, because of the human condition, is difficult! Here is a quick list of things that I've done, said, seen, or received that are easier wins in the art of Code Review Etiquette.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Remove the person (<code>no personal reference</code>)</h2>\n<p>Without realizing it, often the difference between insightful critique and criticism involves personal relationships in communication.</p>\n<p>The lines below dissect a code review comment of the theoretical <code>function</code> where it is suggested that the there is an opportunity to return out of the function early.</p>\n<h4>**You and I: ** Using <code>you</code> or <code>I</code> is probably not offensive intentionally so don't worry. However, over time, involving the person <em>can</em> start to feel less positive‚Äîespecially if there are ever vocal tones added.</h4>\n<pre class=\"language-md\"><code class=\"language-md code-highlight\"><span class=\"code-line\">You should return out of this function early\n</span></code></pre>\n<h4><strong>We:</strong> Using <code>we</code> is inclusive and it seems like a safe thing to say. However, if the person speaking says <code>we</code>, and has not worked on the code at all, it may seem falsely inclusive.</h4>\n<pre class=\"language-md\"><code class=\"language-md code-highlight\"><span class=\"code-line\">we should return out of this function early\n</span></code></pre>\n<h4><strong>No personal reference:</strong> Without personal reference, conversation or review will closely communicate to the problem, idea, or issue</h4>\n<pre class=\"language-md\"><code class=\"language-md code-highlight\"><span class=\"code-line\">return out of this function early\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>Notice how the amount of text needed to communicate the same thing without using personal relationship takes fewer words and speaks most clearly to them too. This helps with human interaction, separate code discussion from personal discussion, and fewer words are needed to communicate the same thing.</p>\n<h2>Keep passionate conversations quiet</h2>\n<p>Passion is an important motivator for improving at things. Even passion when it is critical in nature can be very considerate and motivating. Feedback that is most useful to people is often critical in nature if the person receiving the critique is engaged. This sort of communication comes up a lot during architectural conversations or when discussing new products.</p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote>Feedback that is most useful to a person is often critical in nature if the person receiving the critique is engaged.</blockquote>\n<figcaption><strong>Note:</strong> the person receiving the information <strong>must</strong> be engaged to the critique.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>Imagine this comment when stated with exaggerated physical movement, more excited vocal tone, and higher volume</h4>\n<pre class=\"language-md\"><code class=\"language-md code-highlight\"><span class=\"code-line\">There are 8 web fonts used in this mock which\n</span><span class=\"code-line\">may affect page load speed or even certain tracking metrics\n</span><span class=\"code-line\">that could be caused by new race conditions!\n</span></code></pre>\n<h4>Then, imagine a similar comment, even more terse but stated with a calm demeanour, slower delivery, and a normal vocal volume‚Äîfollowed by a question even</h4>\n<pre class=\"language-md\"><code class=\"language-md code-highlight\"><span class=\"code-line\">There are 8 web fonts used in this mock.\n</span><span class=\"code-line\">This will affect page load speed\n</span><span class=\"code-line\">and possible tracking metrics because of potential race conditions!\n</span><span class=\"code-line\">How can this be improved?\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>Notice, how the comments above are almost the same. The second comment is even more direct. It states a problem as a fact and then requests feedback.</p>\n<p>An important thing to remember when being passionate is taking on a quieter tone. This is a physical decision‚Äînot a social one. Passionate language can be the same and perceived very differently based on the orientation of the communicator's tone. If physical tone (body language), vocal tone, vocal pitch, and vocal volume remain gentle, it is observed that it is much more likely for an audience to remain engaged‚Äîeven if the critique is critical in nature.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is observed that if the tone is seemingly aggressive in nature (exaggerated physical movement, more excited vocal tone, higher volume) that the actual words used can be gentle in nature but the audience can feel very differently. This communication leads to embarrassment, a disengaged audience, and even loss of respect.</p>\n<p>Seemingly aggressive communication is common with passionate communication because human condition wants to protect ideas that humans are passionate about. So, don't worry about it <em>too</em> much if you observe that your audience is disengaged when discussing something that you're passionate about. The key is to remember that if you can create perceived gentle communication that it will be easier for your audience to remain engaged‚Äîeven if they are not initially in agreement.</p>\n<h2>Don't review the author, review on the code</h2>\n<p>Following the conversation above, pointing with written conversation or actual body language in almost any situation is not optimal for good communication. It changes the focal point of the conversation from the context of the conversation to a person or thing.</p>\n<p>The example below shows how this behavior can happen in a code review. The example takes on the same <code>function</code> example as above‚Äîwhere the function can be return sooner.</p>\n<h4>The comment below provides a comment and then a link that goes above 5 levels higher which is actually confusing in the context of the code review.</h4>\n<pre class=\"language-md\"><code class=\"language-md code-highlight\"><span class=\"code-line\">return out of this function earlier.\n</span><span class=\"code-line\">You need to learn about <span class=\"token url\">[<span class=\"token content\">functional programming</span>](<span class=\"token url\">http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/functions.html</span>)</span>\n</span></code></pre>\n<h4>The comment below provides a comment then a pseudo code suggestion</h4>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript code-highlight\"><span class=\"code-line\"><span class=\"token comment\">/*\n</span></span><span class=\"code-line\"><span class=\"token comment\">  return early like this üèÅ\n</span></span><span class=\"code-line\"><span class=\"token comment\">*/</span>\n</span><span class=\"code-line\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">calculateStuff</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">stuff</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token arrow operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n</span><span class=\"code-line\">  <span class=\"token keyword control-flow\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>noStuff<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword control-flow\">return</span>\n</span><span class=\"code-line\">  <span class=\"token comment\">// calculate stuff</span>\n</span><span class=\"code-line\">  <span class=\"token keyword control-flow\">return</span> calculatedStuff\n</span><span class=\"code-line\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>In the two comments above, the first comment causes the reader to go far beyond the issue. The conversation is more abstract‚Äîeven <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/existential\">existential</a>. The second comment refers directly to the issue, then provides a <code>pseudo code</code> example that relates directly to the comment.</p>\n<p>Try to describe what is being discussed and try to remain on topic. This problem seems clear. 'Taking a step back', is a comment that happens often. This may be necessary if the communicator is the one that is miscommunicating. If the communicator is referring that result of very different.</p>\n<h2>You will probably never know if the product was right or good</h2>\n<p>Developers almost always want to re-write things. It is natural to break down problems to tasks and mentalities in real-time. Putting focus on <em>who's</em> and <em>why's</em> of products based on their history is an important to conceptualize because of the context that is gained. The phrase, 'history repeats itself' is key to that sentiment. This is important to remember when critiquing products or when a product you've written is critiqued. There is always a great amount of knowledge to be gained from context.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History\">JavaScript</a> was made in a week, considered a hacky scripting language, and then become the most used programming language in the world. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics\">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs)</a> were supported in 1999, pretty much forgotten about, and now, they continue to gain popularity for the new opportunities they provide. Even the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web</a> (the internet) was meant for document sharing with little anticipation of the current result today. All of these technologies are important to remember when considering software and engineering‚Äîas logical and predictable results are supposed to be, success is often derived from unexpected results! Be open!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The above list is general high-level things that can help with positive engagement when talking about, reviewing, or reading about code or technology. I am a hypocrite. I do all of the things that I've written not to do in the list above. The goal for <em>Code Review Etiquette</em> is developing a standard etiquette to strive for when discussing code in any format. Much like code, communication has things that are right and wrong. I hope to work with other developers to improve <em>Code Review Etiquette</em> by developing standards by which code can be discussed.</p>\n<p>By thinking through the notes above for myself, I have created benchmarks where I have naturally begun to assess my <em>Code Review Etiquette</em>. I'm focusing on improving my communication based on my list daily. I would love to share these sentiments with other engineers to improve. ~Thanks</p>","slug":"code-review-etiquette"},"__N_SSG":true}
