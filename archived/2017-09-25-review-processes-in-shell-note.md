Listed below is one way to find running processes with a shell. This is useful when debugging running processes.

## Example command (finding running 'ruby' processes)
```sh
ps aux | grep -i ruby
```

## Breaking down commands

```sh
# display processes
ps
# flag => all processes
aux
# isolate search of processes
grep -i
# the process we're isolating
ruby
```

## Deeper learning

To further understand this group of commands, try isolating other running processes in your shell.

## Example

```sh
ps aux | grep -i root
```
