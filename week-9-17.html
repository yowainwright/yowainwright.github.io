class="post__section"><div class="post__container"><div class="post__content"><p>This week was a humbling and emotional week for me. I feel more emotional and humbled after being sick but this week <em>the feels</em> were deeper. I&#x27;m transitioning work teams, was reminiscing about my friend Lauren who passed away, and continued learning how to surf.</p>
<h2>Changing Teams</h2>
<p>Changing teams is emotional for me. I put a lot into my work—all of myself for at least a full work day and usually after (by choice). Even though my teammates are usually still around I miss the experience of them working how we were. I grow attached to the ways that I was working. It&#x27;s hard. Besides my working with my last team, there&#x27;s always a learning curve with a new team, and I feel unsure of myself because there I know there are a lot of things that I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<h2>Getting Back to Surfing</h2>
<p>Being sick for a week and a half, I wasn&#x27;t able to surf. I missed being in the water. I also want to improve. I still have a long ways to go to get to where I&#x27;d like to be surfing, so time off is hard.</p>
<p>I was able to get back in the water on Friday the 10th. I went to Venice and dropped in on a few smaller waves which are the main thing that I&#x27;m working on currently.</p>
<p>I want to be able to drop in on waves better. I&#x27;ve been afraid of this part of surfing b/c I often eat shit when I try and swallow a bunch of water as well. It&#x27;s not fun and swallowing a lot of water can lead to getting sick.</p>
<p>On Saturday the 11th, I went surfing El Porto with my friend Justin but decided because of crowds that I would try a different spot. I went to Sunset and found that there were hardly any surfing and a bunch of 1-2ft waves—great for dropping in.</p>

&lt;/figure&gt;<!-- -->
<p>Sunday, the 12th, I surfed Venice. There were 1-4ft waves. They were a bit bigger than Sunset the day before which allowed me to test my drop-in training. I dropped in on what I think may have been a 3ft wave—probably my biggest drop-in. I dropped in on several more waves and swallowed water several times. I found myself wanting to push myself which I had not felt surfing yet but I&#x27;m embracing it.</p>
<h2>Feeling Beta</h2>
<p>A feeling that I was thinking through this week a lot was that of feeling beta. When I write <em>feeling beta</em> I mean <em>feeling like I&#x27;m placing second in a lot of people&#x27;s minds</em>.</p>
<p>I was feeling beta because I was not feeling 100% and because there was language that was communicated to me this week that made me feel <em>less than</em> the person that was communicating to me.</p>
<p>I actually, within myself, like the feeling of <em>being beta</em> once in a while. It tells me that my ego is motivated to improve. I&#x27;m looking forward improving in some places that I would like to. Also, the things that made me feel this way communicate to me that last week and future weeks will be a time of silent growth.</p>
<p>It was a great week! I feel like I have a lot to look forward to over the next weeks. I have some things that I&#x27;m excited about learning and doing.</p></div><div class="post__giscus"></div></div><aside class="aside"><div class="aside__meta"><header class="aside__header"><h3 class="aside__title">Week 9, 2017—Getting Back to Surfing, Changing Teams and Feeling Beta</h3></header><section class="share"><h3 class="share__title">Sharing is caring! 💘</h3><nav class="share__nav"><button class="share__button">Copy Link</button></nav></section></div></aside></section></article><footer class="site-footer" role="contentinfo" itemType="http://schema.org/WPFooter"><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--main"><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--contact"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Contact</h3><address class="site-footer__address"><p class="site-footer__content">Happy to chat, learn, help!</p><p class="site-footer__content"><a href="mailto:yowainwright@gmail.com">yowainwright@gmail.com</a>, Los Angeles, CA</p></address></article><div class="site-footer__col site-footer__col site-footer__col--social"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Connect</h3><nav class="social-footer"><ul class="social-list"><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://github.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Github</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://instagram.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Instragram</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrywainwright/" class="social-list__link">LinkedIn</a></li></ul></nav></div><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--self"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--self">About</h3><figure class="site-footer__figure"><img class="media--circular site-footer__image" src="https://yowainwright.imgix.net/portraits/me-smiling.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Me smiling with a beard"/><figcaption class="site-footer__caption"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/"><strong>jeffry.in</strong>, <!-- -->2023</a>, is the blog of<!-- --> <a class="site-footer__link" href="/about">Jeffry (Jeff) Wainwright</a>, a software engineer, person, living in Los Angeles.</figcaption></figure></article></section><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--last"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--last"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/">jeffry.in ⚡️</a>, <!-- -->2023</h3></section></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Week 9, 2017—Getting Back to Surfing, Changing Teams and Feeling Beta","layout":"post","readNext":"/","path":"/week-9-17/","meta":"Week 9, 2017—This week I was feeling pretty beta after changing teams, recovering from being sick and getting back to surfing.","featured_image":"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-9/wave-rocks-4.jpg","post_index":36,"categories":["note","story"],"date":"March 13, 2017"},"content":"\nThis week was a humbling and emotional week for me.
