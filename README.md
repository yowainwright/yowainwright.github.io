If you'd like to help me with this blog:
-   download the repository
-   building locally
--   `bundle exec jekyll serve -w --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml`
--   The command above allows us to have a configurable `site.url` for links between prod & dev environments
-  then submit a pull request (without merge conflicts preferably)
