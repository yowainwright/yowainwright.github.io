## About

I'm a husband, dad, & [software engineer](https://jeffry.in). When I'm not writing code, I enjoy fitness activities.<br>[Surfing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrlE4oSnF05/) and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335) are my current favorites.

I write articles on my blog, [Jeffry.in](https://jeffry.in), & have written articles for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/?s=yowainwright).<br>
I've presented at [JS.LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YQ8BGSOsyE) on the benefits of CI/CD tools.

I'm currently a Principal Engineer at [Lokker](https://lokker.com), working on data privacy compliance software.
