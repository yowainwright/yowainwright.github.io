## About

I'm a software engineer at [Currency](https://www.gocurrency.com/). I was born in South Dakota but grew internationally. I enjoy [art](https://www.instagram.com/porkypaints/), [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/127322575?si=6zrJlJX9RcaOk5mp-iJnJg), [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335), and [surfing](https://www.instagram.com/yowainwright/).

## Work

Currently, I'm creating cross app tools to make building new frontend apps easier at Currency using Lerna, React, and TypeScript. Currency's products aim to give our customers great integrations for providing/getting financing for certain loan types.

Formally, I've worked at/on:

- **[Dollar Shave Club](https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/):** Led building [dynamic landing pages](https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/join/shave-set) with Contentful and React
- **[Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/):** Built frontend of Headless CMS using Backbone and jQuery
- **[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/):** Same as Billboard
- **[California Psychics](https://www.californiapsychics.com/):** Built responsive UI using jQuery and CSS
- **[Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/):** Built UI using jQuery and CSS

## Fun

Outside of work, I support and work on several open source projects.

Currently (4.13.20), I'm actively working on:

- **[Common Utilities](https://github.com/yowainwright/common-utilities):** Common javascript utility functions
- **[DataStructures](https://github.com/yowainwright/datastructures):** TypeScript Data Structures
- **[Heartly](https://github.com/heartly/heartly):** Tools for friendlier coding
- **[MacRustle](https://github.com/yowainwright/macrustle):** Setup instructions "rustled up" for coding on a Mac

Other projects I wrote/support:

- **[ES Check](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/es-check):** Checks the version of ES in JavaScript files with shell commands
- **[StickyBits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits):** Stickybits is an alternative to position: sticky polyfills
- **[Scrolldir](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/scrolldir):** y-axis scroll direction without jitter
- **[Shave](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/shave):** a minimal JavaScript Plugin for Truncated text
- **[Reframe.js](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/reframe.js):** a JavaScript Plugin for reframing html elements so they're an intrinsic ratio of the originalâ€”great for embeds
