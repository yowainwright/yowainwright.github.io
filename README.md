## In brief ðŸ’¼

This blog now runs on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/). Gatsby is a site generator built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/).

## Setting up this blog

This site is dependent on a few Gatsby plugins which make the _magic_ happen:
- gatsby-plugin-google-analytics



Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`
