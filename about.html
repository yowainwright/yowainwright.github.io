				<p class="introduction with-cap">
				Professionaly, I build User Interfaces (UI's) and Front End Logic for web pages and applications. I like to build things a lot and learn about how things work from start to finish beyond the computer. I enjoy design, cats, cereal and do art projects when I have a little free time. I'm very into running and rock climbing which leads me to have wilderness adventures.
				</p>

				<p>
				When I was young I would watch my dad maticulously build things with his hands. The process of turning a log of wood become a dresser or table was fasinating to me.
				</p>
				<p>
				I am a life long creator of <em>things</em>. I studied painting for most of my life which led me to learning to air brush, sculpt, make furniture and design for print. It wasn't until I took a web design class in 2006-7 that I started to code. I was immediately hooked. At the time I was finishing up another degree in Design but the majority of my efforts went to building websites. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In my transition from art and design I started to build webpages for all of my design projects. I started building webpages using flash and mainly the visual portion of dreamweaver. This lead to my first job working on a PHP based site where I was mainly doing slice and dice designs and email.
				</p>
				<p>
				My desire to learn led me to building boutique websites using dreamweaver and wordpress from small clients around Chicago. After doing this for a year, I moved to DC and was given the opportunity to design and build the front end framework for <a href="http://nasdaq.com">NASDAQ.com</a>. It was a giant leap and led to me building a lot of my high traffic work; a lot of my code base is still used now.

				<h2 class="ui dividing header"><i class="bullseye icon"></i> Aspirations</h2>
				<p>
				My goal is to continue to learn and understand front end development, online marketing and web + application design. Eventually I would like to naturally get into consultant and product work. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I have done the majority of my professional work with .NET but for a long time I built all of my side projects using wordpress. I've had exposure to CQ5, Sitecore and a little Drupal as well. I am now getting into Ruby a bit. This site is built on Jekyll. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Within each job I've taken on I've learned that keeping everything as simple as possible is a key to success and working with a team. I like to focus on coding as modularly as possible and try to make sure work is clear and documented.

				<h2 class="ui dividing header"><i class="suitcase icon"></i> History</h2>
				<p>
				Born in Rapid City, South Dakota, I spent a lot of my youth in the Black Hills not imagining much beyond the small community I was in. My parents (mom) went into Diplomacy when I was 7 and my small town roots were taken international. Travelling and living abroad made me very aware of the differences between cultures and the similarities of people which I feel plays a big part in my work as a Designer and Developer.
				</p>
				<p>
				I moved to Barbados when I was 8 and discovered table tennis. I spent to next years training to become one of the top young <em>Bajun</em> players along with also playing tennis competitively, body boarding and building forts. 
				</p>
				<p>
				At 13, I was living in Prague. I enjoyed the culture and the old parts of the town. We travelled a lot as a family and I got to see a lot of Central Europe. 
				</p>
				<p>
				After moving back to the United States for my Junior and Senior Year of High School, I went to college at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. While there, I spent my holidays in Albania, Bosnia and Italy with my parents work.
				</p>
				<p>
				Learning a lot in my travels and diverse culture made me interested in communicating as an individual but also working within a team. I find a key ingredient in my work is finding where my individuality is successful and also where I can be uniform to my team.
