				<p class="introduction with-cap">
				Professionaly, I build User Interfaces (UI's) and Front End Logic for web pages and applications. I like to build things in general and learn about how things work beyond the computer. I enjoy design, cats, cereal and I do art projects when I have a little free time. Also, I'm runner, rock climber and adventurer which leads me to have wilderness adventures.

				<p>
				When I was young I would watch my dad maticulously build things with his hands. The process of turning a log of wood into a table was fasinating to me.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I am a life long creator of <em>things</em>. I've been painting for most of my life which led me to learning to air brush, sculpt, make furniture and design for print. It wasn't until I took a web design class in 2006-7 that I started to code. I was immediately hooked. At the time I was finishing up another degree in Design but the majority of my efforts went to building websites.

				My desire to learn landing me my first jobs in Web Design building boutique websites using dreamweaver and wordpress for small clients around Chicago. After doing this for a year, I moved to DC and was given the opportunity to design and build a new front end framework for <a href="http://nasdaq.com">NASDAQ.com</a>. Since then I have been working a lot of high traffic site focusing on Design, User Interfaces and Front End Development.

				<h2 class="ui dividing header"><i class="bullseye icon"></i> Aspirations</h2>
				<p>
				Professionally, my goal is to continue progress as front end developer, designer and user experience professional. Eventually I would like to naturally get into consultant and product work. I've worked mainly in .NET but being front end agnostic, I've worked with many frameworks. I've worked with CQ5, Sitecore and wordpress. I am now getting into Ruby. This site is built on Jekyll.

				<h2 class="ui dividing header"><i class="suitcase icon"></i> History</h2>
				<p>
				Born in Rapid City, South Dakota, I spent a lot of my youth in the Black Hills not imagining much beyond the Black Hills. My parents (mom) went into Diplomacy when I was 7 and my small town roots were taken international. Travelling and living abroad made me very aware of the differences between cultures and the similarities of people which I feel plays a big part in my work as a Designer and Developer.
				</p>
				<p>
				I moved to Barbados when I was 8 and discovered table tennis. I spent to next years training to become one of the top young <em>Bajun</em> players along with also playing tennis competitively, body boarding and building forts. 
				</p>
				<p>
				At 13, I was living in Prague. I enjoyed the culture and the old parts of the town. We travelled a lot as a family and I got to see a lot of Central Europe. 
				</p>
				<p>
				After moving back to the United States for my Junior and Senior Year of High School, I went to college at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. While there, I spent my holidays in Albania, Bosnia and Italy with my parents work.
				</p>
				<p>
				Learning a lot in my travels and diverse culture made me interested in communicating as an individual but also working within a team. I find a key ingredient in my work is finding where my individuality is successful and also where I can be an asset to my team.
