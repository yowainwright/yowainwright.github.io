<p><strong>Note:</strong> Improving Code Review Etiquette, because of the human condition, is difficult! Here is a quick list of things that I&#x27;ve done, said, seen, or received that are easier wins in the art of Code Review Etiquette.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Remove the person (<code>no personal reference</code>)</h2>
<p>Without realizing it, often the difference between insightful critique and criticism involves personal relationships in communication.</p>
<p>The lines below dissect a code review comment of the theoretical <code>function</code> where it is suggested that the there is an opportunity to return out of the function early.</p>
<h4>**You and I: ** Using <code>you</code> or <code>I</code> is probably not offensive intentionally so don&#x27;t worry. However, over time, involving the person <em>can</em> start to feel less positive—especially if there are ever vocal tones added.</h4>
<pre><code class="language-md">You should return out of this function early
</code></pre>
<h4><strong>We:</strong> Using <code>we</code> is inclusive and it seems like a safe thing to say. However, if the person speaking says <code>we</code>, and has not worked on the code at all, it may seem falsely inclusive.</h4>
<pre><code class="language-md">we should return out of this function early
</code></pre>
<h4><strong>No personal reference:</strong> Without personal reference, conversation or review will closely communicate to the problem, idea, or issue</h4>
<pre><code class="language-md">return out of this function early
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the amount of text needed to communicate the same thing without using personal relationship takes fewer words and speaks most clearly to them too. This helps with human interaction, separate code discussion from personal discussion, and fewer words are needed to communicate the same thing.</p>
<h2>Keep passionate conversations quiet</h2>
<p>Passion is an important motivator for improving at things. Even passion when it is critical in nature can be very considerate and motivating. Feedback that is most useful to people is often critical in nature if the person receiving the critique is engaged. This sort of communication comes up a lot during architectural conversations or when discussing new products.</p>
<!-- -->&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Feedback that is most useful to a person is often critical in nature if the person receiving the critique is engaged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; the person receiving the information &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be engaged to the critique.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;<!-- -->
<h4>Imagine this comment when stated with exaggerated physical movement, more excited vocal tone, and higher volume</h4>
<pre><code class="language-md">There are 8 web fonts used in this mock which
may affect page load speed or even certain tracking metrics
that could be caused by new race conditions!
</code></pre>
<h4>Then, imagine a similar comment, even more terse but stated with a calm demeanour, slower delivery, and a normal vocal volume—followed by a question even</h4>
<pre><code class="language-md">There are 8 web fonts used in this mock.
This will affect page load speed
and possible tracking metrics because of potential race conditions!
How can this be improved?
</code></pre>
<p>Notice, how the comments above are almost the same. The second comment is even more direct. It states a problem as a fact and then requests feedback.</p>
<p>An important thing to remember when being passionate is taking on a quieter tone. This is a physical decision—not a social one. Passionate language can be the same and perceived very differently based on the orientation of the communicator&#x27;s tone. If physical tone (body language), vocal tone, vocal pitch, and vocal volume remain gentle, it is observed that it is much more likely for an audience to remain engaged—even if the critique is critical in nature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is observed that if the tone is seemingly aggressive in nature (exaggerated physical movement, more excited vocal tone, higher volume) that the actual words used can be gentle in nature but the audience can feel very differently. This communication leads to embarrassment, a disengaged audience, and even loss of respect.</p>
<p>Seemingly aggressive communication is common with passionate communication because human condition wants to protect ideas that humans are passionate about. So, don&#x27;t worry about it <em>too</em> much if you observe that your audience is disengaged when discussing something that you&#x27;re passionate about. The key is to remember that if you can create perceived gentle communication that it will be easier for your audience to remain engaged—even if they are not initially in agreement.</p>
<h2>Don&#x27;t review the author, review on the code</h2>
<p>Following the conversation above, pointing with written conversation or actual body language in almost any situation is not optimal for good communication. It changes the focal point of the conversation from the context of the conversation to a person or thing.</p>
<p>The example below shows how this behavior can happen in a code review. The example takes on the same <code>function</code> example as above—where the function can be return sooner.</p>
<h4>The comment below provides a comment and then a link that goes above 5 levels higher which is actually confusing in the context of the code review.</h4>
<pre><code class="language-md">return out of this function earlier.
You need to learn about [functional programming](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/functions.html)
</code></pre>
<h4>The comment below provides a comment then a pseudo code suggestion</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">/*
  return early like this 🏁
*/
const calculateStuff = (stuff) =&gt; {
  if (noStuff) return
  // calculate stuff
  return calculatedStuff
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the two comments above, the first comment causes the reader to go far beyond the issue. The conversation is more abstract—even <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/existential">existential</a>. The second comment refers directly to the issue, then provides a <code>pseudo code</code> example that relates directly to the comment.</p>
<p>Try to describe what is being discussed and try to remain on topic. This problem seems clear. &#x27;Taking a step back&#x27;, is a comment that happens often. This may be necessary if the communicator is the one that is miscommunicating. If the communicator is referring that result of very different.</p>
<h2>You will probably never know if the product was right or good</h2>
<p>Developers almost always want to re-write things. It is natural to break down problems to tasks and mentalities in real-time. Putting focus on <em>who&#x27;s</em> and <em>why&#x27;s</em> of products based on their history is an important to conceptualize because of the context that is gained. The phrase, &#x27;history repeats itself&#x27; is key to that sentiment. This is important to remember when critiquing products or when a product you&#x27;ve written is critiqued. There is always a great amount of knowledge to be gained from context.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History">JavaScript</a> was made in a week, considered a hacky scripting language, and then become the most used programming language in the world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs)</a> were supported in 1999, pretty much forgotten about, and now, they continue to gain popularity for the new opportunities they provide. Even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> (the internet) was meant for document sharing with little anticipation of the current result today. All of these technologies are important to remember when considering software and engineering—as logical and predictable results are supposed to be, success is often derived from unexpected results! Be open!</p>
<hr/>
<p>The above list is general high-level things that can help with positive engagement when talking about, reviewing, or reading about code or technology. I am a hypocrite. I do all of the things that I&#x27;ve written not to do in the list above. The goal for <em>Code Review Etiquette</em> is developing a standard etiquette to strive for when discussing code in any format. Much like code, communication has things that are right and wrong. I hope to work with other developers to improve <em>Code Review Etiquette</em> by developing standards by which code can be discussed.</p>
<p>By thinking through the notes above for myself, I have created benchmarks where I have naturally begun to assess my <em>Code Review Etiquette</em>. I&#x27;m focusing on improving my communication based on my list daily. I would love to share these sentiments with other engineers to improve. ~Thanks</p></div><div class="post__giscus"></div></div><aside class="aside"><div class="aside__meta"><header class="aside__header"><h3 class="aside__title">Can Code Review Etiquette be a thing?

This sort of communication comes up a lot during architectural conversations or when discussing new products.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003eFeedback that is most useful to a person is often critical in nature if the person receiving the critique is engaged.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u003c/strong\u003e the person receiving the information \u003cstrong\u003emust\u003c/strong\u003e be engaged to the critique.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n#### Imagine this comment when stated with exaggerated physical movement, more excited vocal tone, and higher volume\n\n```md\nThere are 8 web fonts used in this mock which\nmay affect page load speed or even certain tracking metrics\nthat could be caused by new race conditions!\n```\n\n#### Then, imagine a similar comment, even more terse but stated with a calm demeanour, slower delivery, and a normal vocal volume—followed by a question even\n\n```md\nThere are 8 web fonts used in this mock.\nThis will affect page load speed\nand possible tracking metrics because of potential race conditions!\nHow can this be improved?\n```\n\nNotice, how the comments above are almost the same. The second comment is even more direct. It states a problem as a fact and then requests feedback.\n\nAn important thing to remember when being passionate is taking on a quieter tone. This is a physical decision—not a social one. Passionate language can be the same and perceived very differently based on the orientation of the communicator's tone. If physical tone (body language), vocal tone, vocal pitch, and vocal volume remain gentle, it is observed that it is much more likely for an audience to remain engaged—even if the critique is critical in nature.\n\nFurthermore, it is observed that if the tone is seemingly aggressive in nature (exaggerated physical movement, more excited vocal tone, higher volume) that the actual words used can be gentle in nature but the audience can feel very differently. This communication leads to embarrassment, a disengaged audience, and even loss of respect.\n\nSeemingly aggressive communication is common with passionate communication because human condition wants to protect ideas that humans are passionate about. So, don't worry about it _too_ much if you observe that your audience is disengaged when discussing something that you're passionate about. The key is to remember that if you can create perceived gentle communication that it will be easier for your audience to remain engaged—even if they are not initially in agreement.\n\n## Don't review the author, review on the code\n\nFollowing the conversation above, pointing with written conversation or actual body language in almost any situation is not optimal for good communication. It changes the focal point of the conversation from the context of the conversation to a person or thing.\n\nThe example below shows how this behavior can happen in a code review. The example takes on the same `function` example as above—where the function can be return sooner.\n\n#### The comment below provides a comment and then a link that goes above 5 levels higher which is actually confusing in the context of the code review.\n\n```md\nreturn out of this function earlier.\nYou need to learn about [functional programming](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/functions.html)\n```\n\n#### The comment below provides a comment then a pseudo code suggestion\n\n```javascript\n/*\n  return early like this 🏁\n*/\nconst calculateStuff = (stuff) =\u003e {\n  if (noStuff) return\n  // calculate stuff\n  return calculatedStuff\n}\n```\n\nIn the two comments above, the first comment causes the reader to go far beyond the issue. The conversation is more abstract—even [existential](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/existential). The second comment refers directly to the issue, then provides a `pseudo code` example that relates directly to the comment.\n\nTry to describe what is being discussed and try to remain on topic. This problem seems clear. 'Taking a step back', is a comment that happens often. This may be necessary if the communicator is the one that is miscommunicating. If the communicator is referring that result of very different.\n\n## You will probably never know if the product was right or good\n\nDevelopers almost always want to re-write things. It is natural to break down problems to tasks and mentalities in real-time. Putting focus on _who's_ and _why's_ of products based on their history is an important to conceptualize because of the context that is gained. The phrase, 'history repeats itself' is key to that sentiment. This is important to remember when critiquing products or when a product you've written is critiqued. There is always a great amount of knowledge to be gained from context.\n\n[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History) was made in a week, considered a hacky scripting language, and then become the most used programming language in the world. [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) were supported in 1999, pretty much forgotten about, and now, they continue to gain popularity for the new opportunities they provide. Even the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) (the internet) was meant for document sharing with little anticipation of the current result today. All of these technologies are important to remember when considering software and engineering—as logical and predictable results are supposed to be, success is often derived from unexpected results! Be open!\n\n---\n\nThe above list is general high-level things that can help with positive engagement when talking about, reviewing, or reading about code or technology. I am a hypocrite. I do all of the things that I've written not to do in the list above. The goal for _Code Review Etiquette_ is developing a standard etiquette to strive for when discussing code in any format. Much like code, communication has things that are right and wrong. I hope to work with other developers to improve _Code Review Etiquette_ by developing standards by which code can be discussed.\n\nBy thinking through the notes above for myself, I have created benchmarks where I have naturally begun to assess my _Code Review Etiquette_. I'm focusing on improving my communication based on my list daily. I would love to share these sentiments with other engineers to improve. ~Thanks\n"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[slug]","query":{"slug":"code-review-etiquette"},"buildId":"PAppp4R1qt8AvnFA5Gt4r","assetPrefix":".","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
