I was sick the whole week so I sat A LOT. Besides sitting a lot, a few friends started on new adventures and a close friend of mine passed away. Workwise, I started working on some cool analytics stuff and I'm continuing to work on some cool open source products.</p>
<h2>Fighting the flu</h2>
<p>I became fully sick on Monday which I faught through and went to work. I regret that decision but I was able to make Tuesday way worse (sarcasm)! I just kept getting more sick after that. On Friday, I went to Urgent Care and from there—it worked out well. I was worried that I had pneumonia so I was happy to learn that I only had the flu! The good doctors gave me medication and I spent the weekend recovering.</p>
<h2>Moving on</h2>
<p>I had a dear friend of mine pass away. It's been on my mind all week. I'd met this person at the beginning of 2014 and we'd gone on some epic trips together. She helped me a lot with laughter. I first met her when I was recovering from pneumonia. Before having pneumonia I was able to do several things that I haven't been able to do after—like run several miles pretty fast. I was pretty depressed about this change and then my friend made fun of me, "But you can still run, right?". She was right. Her vibes about my recovery made me feel okay to complain—because it was like a joke when she'd make fun of me. Her attitude also motivated me to heal. I'm very thankful for her outlook. I'll never forget it.</p>
<h2>Analytics and Open Source</h2>
<p>I'm switching over to an analytics project and I'm pumped about it. I'd started working on a product for this project a while ago and I'm happy to be working on something that is a bit more data/javascript heavy. As far as open source, I hope to do the landing page for <a href="https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits">stickybits</a> this week which will be fun.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm thankful for my life and the goals I have to attain. I feel like I have so much more to say in this life. I hope my words will reflect a bit of what I learned from my dear friend that passed. I'll miss her forever and try to remember the gifts I received from her.</p></div><div class="post__giscus"></div></div><aside class="aside"><div class="aside__meta"><header class="aside__header"><h3 class="aside__title">Week 8, 2017—Losing a few friends, being sick, transitioning and writing some code</h3></header><section class="share"><nav class="share__nav"><button class="share__button">Share Article Link</button></nav></section></div></aside></section></article><footer class="site-footer" role="contentinfo" itemType="http://schema.org/WPFooter"><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--main"><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--contact"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Contact</h3><address class="site-footer__address"><p class="site-footer__content">Happy to chat, learn, help!</p><p class="site-footer__content"><a href="mailto:yowainwright@gmail.com">yowainwright@gmail.com</a>, Los Angeles, CA</p></address></article><div class="site-footer__col site-footer__col site-footer__col--social"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Connect</h3><nav class="social-footer"><ul class="social-list"><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://github.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Github</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://instagram.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Instragram</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrywainwright/" class="social-list__link">LinkedIn</a></li></ul></nav></div><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--self"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--self">About</h3><figure class="site-footer__figure"><img class="media--circular site-footer__image" src="https://yowainwright.imgix.net/portraits/me-smiling.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Me smiling with a beard"/><figcaption class="site-footer__caption"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/"><strong>jeffry.in</strong>, <!-- -->2025</a>, is the blog of<!-- --> <a class="site-footer__link" href="/about">Jeffry (Jeff) Wainwright</a>, a software engineer, person, living in Los Angeles.</figcaption></figure></article></section><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--last"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--last"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/">jeffry.in</a>, <!-- -->2025</h3></section></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Week 8, 2017—Losing a few friends, being sick, transitioning and writing some code","meta":"Week 8, 2017—This week I was sick, lost a few friends and started to do some transitioning.","categories":["note","story"],"date":"March 5, 2017","path":"/week-8-17"},"content":"\u003cp\u003eWeek 8 was great for sitting.
