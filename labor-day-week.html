<h2>How I met the Pitts</h2>
<p>How we met is always a story I like to tell. I used to get coffee at a coffee spot in Manhattan Beach called <a href="https://www.twogunsespresso.com/">Two Guns</a>. I not a huge coffee connoisseur but I they had the best Donuts I'd ever had. I would go there most weekends to get a donut. I would see different nice bikes out front and later learned they were Brett's. Brett and I talked about cycling sometimes for the next few years. Eventually we went for a bike ride. During the ride, I started telling Brett about why I went to Two Guns—the donuts. He told me that his fiancée Ashley was actually the person that had started making donuts there. Brett and I later rode bikes for thousands of miles and would often get back from a ride to fresh made bread by Ashley who is the most passionate person about bread that I have ever met.</p>

<p>The first time I went to Dallas a few years ago, I didn't anticipate how much I would like it. There are a lot a great restaurants, the skyline is beautiful and the people are friendly. A new addition in the past few years are ride share bikes. I rode a <a href="https://www.limebike.com/">Limebike</a> the entire time I was there, including 2 rides to White Rock Lake.</p>

<p>It was great seeing Brett and Ashley. I'm watching them grow up—within themselves, in their careers, and with each other.</p></div><div class="post__giscus"></div></div><aside class="aside"><div class="aside__meta"><header class="aside__header"><h3 class="aside__title">2017 Labor Day Week in Dallas</h3></header><section class="share"><nav class="share__nav"><button class="share__button">Share Article Link</button></nav></section></div></aside></section></article><footer class="site-footer" role="contentinfo" itemType="http://schema.org/WPFooter"><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--main"><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--contact"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Contact</h3><address class="site-footer__address"><p class="site-footer__content">Happy to chat, learn, help!</p><p class="site-footer__content"><a href="mailto:yowainwright@gmail.com">yowainwright@gmail.com</a>, Los Angeles, CA</p></address></article><div class="site-footer__col site-footer__col site-footer__col--social"><h3 class="site-footer__title">Connect</h3><nav class="social-footer"><ul class="social-list"><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://github.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Github</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://instagram.com/yowainwright" class="social-list__link">Instragram</a></li><li class="social-list__item social-list__item--showing"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrywainwright/" class="social-list__link">LinkedIn</a></li></ul></nav></div><article class="site-footer__col site-footer__col--self"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--self">About</h3><figure class="site-footer__figure"><img class="media--circular site-footer__image" src="https://yowainwright.imgix.net/portraits/me-smiling.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Me smiling with a beard"/><figcaption class="site-footer__caption"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/"><strong>jeffry.in</strong>, <!-- -->2024</a>, is the blog of<!-- --> <a class="site-footer__link" href="/about">Jeffry (Jeff) Wainwright</a>, a software engineer, person, living in Los Angeles.</figcaption></figure></article></section><section class="site-footer__wrapper site-footer__wrapper--last"><h3 class="site-footer__title site-footer__title--last"><a class="site-footer__link" href="/">jeffry.in</a>, <!-- -->2024</h3></section></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"2017 Labor Day Week in Dallas","meta":"This year I, Jeff Wainwright, spent Labor Day in Dallas with friends.","categories":["story"],"date":"September 9, 2017","path":"/labor-day-week"},"content":"\u003cp\u003eThis past week, I went to Dallas to visit Brett and Ashley Pitt—close friends of mine.
