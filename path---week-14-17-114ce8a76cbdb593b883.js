Weâ€™re were on the verge of releasing our new version and creating better test coverage.\nOutside of work, I found time to surf and get to the gym. We had a 3 day weekend so I surfed all 3 days and went down the coast to surf Encinitas.</p>\n<h2>Analytics and Stickybits</h2>\n<p>The ramp up time to productivity on the analytics project is taking some time. The team is good. We just have to get all parts of the team machine firingâ€”and in unison. Last week, I began to see this happening. Iâ€™m hoping to see more and faster products gains in the following weeks. </p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits">Stickybits</a>, my most recent User Interface Open Source project is reaching maturity and Iâ€™ve been working hard on promoting it. Not having many followers in the tech space makes that tough but Iâ€™ve started to make gains which is good because Iâ€™ve put some time in understanding <code>position: sticky</code> and thinking about itâ€™s benefits.</p>\n<h2>Iâ€™ve been surfing a lot lately</h2>\n<p>Surfing has been great for me. I started a few years ago with my roommate at that time, <a href="http://garretmartucci.com/">Garret Martucci</a>. Garret and I were living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Beach,_California">Manhattan Beach, CA</a> so we headed down to beach and surfed a few times. After Garret and I moved out, I stopped surfing before I had really started. Fast forward a few years, I met my friend and co-worker <a href="http://justinintime.com/">Justin Berg</a>. We started meeting before work and surfing. Before I knew it, I was going surfing as much as I could. </p>\n<p>As of now, Iâ€™ve been surfing a lot since last September. It challenges and gives me satisfaction. I find even on the days I struggle catching waves or get into a wave just right, Iâ€™m given the opportunity to get frustrated in the ocean by myselfâ€”and I <em>usually</em> get a better work out. ðŸ™ƒ Then, some days, I feel something new â€˜clickâ€™ and my mind is opened to something new I enjoy about surfing. This past weekend, turning left started to â€˜clickâ€™ for me. It felt exhilarating and empowering to be able to consider going either way on a wave (left or right).</p>\n<html><head></head><body><figure>\n  \n</figure></body></html>',frontmatter:{featured_image:"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-14/countyline.jpg",meta:"Week 14, I'm releasing a new analytics product and I was able to stay in Encinitas which  for the weekend.",title:"Week 14, releasing analytics updates and my first trip South in 2017",date:"April 19, 2017"}}},pathContext:{path:"/week-14-17/"}}}});
