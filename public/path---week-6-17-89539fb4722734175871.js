I pushed my 3000th commit of the year on Github which was very important for me. At work, we released major analytics updates and I began working on some simpler things that can really improve performance—like code splitting. </p>\n<h2>Rain In Southern California</h2>\n<p>One of my best friends, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/quintinradford\">Quitin Radford</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/903862437/sporklettm-0\">Uensil</a> and his wife Jill (who I would now call a friend) came and visited. They went surfing with me at Venice Beach's Breakwater without wetsuits because I didn't have extras which were pretty impressive because the water is frigid in February. Jill paddled out first. Other surfers didn't know what to think. They were chuckling subtly under their breath. Until she started charging waves. She didn't seem to care about the weather at all. It was inspiring. I think the whole beach was stoked!</p>\n<p>We had more rain the day after our surf adventure. This particular rain was called <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/los-angeles-storm-rain-california-2017-2\">The Storm of the Decade</a>. Quintin, Jill and I went out to surf just before the storm and realized quickly that that would have been a bad idea. We, instead, went up the coast on Highway 1 to enjoy the storm from the ocean caves around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Carrillo\">Leo Carillo</a>. It was a fantastic moment—one that I will not forget. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-6/quintin-jill.jpg?w=800&h=800&crop=focalpoint&auto=format\" alt=\"Leo Carillo Rock and Stream at Leo Carillo State Beach in California.\" />\n</figure>\n<h2>3000 Commits on Github and 2.5k Stars</h2>\n<p>I'm thankful for my line of work and the teams I work with.  I sometimes feel like I don't fit the mold of the work that I do. Tools like Github point out—'Hey, this person gets shit done!' And I do. I will continue to release simple usable open source projects and commit at a rapid rate for the projects that I'm working on. It makes me feel good to have tools that show my value. Thanks, Github!</p>\n<h2>Building Analytics Products</h2>\n<p>Besides my own little Github atta-boy, we released an analytics update to the product that I've been working on which went smashingly well. This result is from our team's great communication on this project. I continue to find that when communication is in sync with project goals—the code needed is much easier to write. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion, I'm thankful full a lot this week</h2>\n<p>I'm very thankful that I got to meet Jill, Quintin's wife. She is definitely who I hoped for in a partner for my good friend. I'm also thankful to be able to do the work that I do. I hope over this year I'm able to write more open source plugins and tools that people find valuable and continue to be a valued contributor to my team.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Week 6, 2017—Looking for rainbows in the rain, shipping analytics and best friends",date:"February 25, 2017"}}},pathContext:{path:"/week-6-17/"}}}});
