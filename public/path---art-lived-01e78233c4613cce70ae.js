I took the sec to say, \'Wow! That painting is beautiful!\'. Little did I know that this statement would lead to a wild night and early morning!</p>\n<p>As I was leaving after a day of <em>data planning</em> the owner of the painting says, \'bet that painting would look great on a wall in your house!\'. I agreed and we decided to wrap the painting in cloth &#x26; tie to my car safe and sound ... Right? Wrong! I was driving on the 10 (Los Angeles Area Highway towards Downtown LA (where I currently live) and suddenly <em>Whoosh</em>. The painting was flying through the air. I was initially scared that it was going to cause problems but it landed flat on the front of a semi &#x26; immediately looked to explode.</p>\n<p><img src="https://yowainwright.imgix.net/art-lived/art-lived-broken.jpg" alt="Image of the painting after being hit"></p>\n<p>When I got home, I called the person that had given me the painting &#x26; told him what happened. We sat on opposite ends of the phone silently for a sec. Then he goes, \'Do you remember where on the highway the painting flew off?\'. Yup (I knew)! He says, \'Come get me!\'. I go and pick him up &#x26; we go searching for the painting on the 10 [again, Los Angeles Highway (always busy)] &#x26; there it is sitting on the side of the Freeway. It might as well have been folded it was so perfect. We pull over &#x26; pick up the painting. As we are driving to the highway exit we hear a <em>whoop whoop whoop</em>. I had a flat tire. One of the wood chips from the painting\'s frame had lodged itself right into my tire. The tire was flatten almost immediately.</p>\n<p>So there we were fixing a flat at about 3am on <em>Crenshaw</em>. Crenshaw is not the safest spot in LA to fix a flat. A gentleman walks by <em>looking down on his luck</em> &#x26; says, \'your lucky ... flats can be fixed!\'. He was right. I drove the owner of the painting home &#x26; before we bid our good byes he unfolded the painting &#x26; we looked at it - still beautiful. Art, for the night, lived!</p>\n<p>After scrambling to get my car fixed &#x26; other obligations, I didn\'t have time for the <em>lemonade</em> picture post on Facebook but somehow I hoped that after sharing this story - it doesn\'t matter. I think that recovering the painting was actually a better symbol &#x26; I hope that my friend feels the same.</p>\n<p><img src="https://yowainwright.imgix.net/art-lived/art-lived-finished2.jpg" alt="Image of the painting after being rebuilt"></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Art Lived, A Story Of How A Painting Was Given, Lost & Found",date:"October 21, 2012"}}},pathContext:{path:"/art-lived/"}}}});
