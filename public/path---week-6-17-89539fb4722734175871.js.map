They went surfing with me at Venice Beach's Breakwater without wetsuits because I didn't have extras which were pretty impressive because the water is frigid in February. Jill paddled out first. Other surfers didn't know what to think. They were chuckling subtly under their breath. Until she started charging waves. She didn't seem to care about the weather at all. It was inspiring. I think the whole beach was stoked!</p>\\n<p>We had more rain the day after our surf adventure. This particular rain was called <a href=\\\"http://www.businessinsider.com/los-angeles-storm-rain-california-2017-2\\\">The Storm of the Decade</a>. Quintin, Jill and I went out to surf just before the storm and realized quickly that that would have been a bad idea.

I sometimes feel like I don't fit the mold of the work that I do. Tools like Github point out—'Hey, this person gets shit done!' And I do.
