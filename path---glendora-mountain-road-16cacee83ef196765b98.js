Beware if you follow Google directions for bicycles you WILL end up on a hiking trail not suited for road bikes unless you &#x26; your bike are way more bad ass than me.</p>\n<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5804/23722600469_f8a9a34ba0_b.jpg" alt="A few miles into the GMR boast beautiful canyon view with LA in the distance."></p>\n<p>Water &#x26; Food: That’s a pretty cool part about this ride because, well, you don’t have to worry much. There’s water &#x26; food in Azusa &#x26; there’s water &#x26; food in Mount Baldy Village so if you plan on 20 miles in between both points - you should be good.</p>\n<p>Key sites: During most of the ride you’ll have great views. Particularly, you’ll be able to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Dam">San Gabriel Reservoir</a> which, I’ve semi-joked with friends about being the last visible water in LA. You’ll also be able to see Mount Baldy &#x26; other high hills &#x26; mounts which do a great job of making a rider feel small &#x26; in adequate in the world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You’ll also be able to see Mount Baldy &#x26; other high hills &#x26; mounts which do a great job of making a rider feel small &#x26; in adequate to the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The trip personally for me was bitter sweet. One of my best riding buds, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/1283635?oq=bre">Brett Pitts</a>, is about to move so we decided we had to make the ride happen. We zipped up the inline from Azusa &#x26; raced on the ridge after switching to <a href="http://www.toughascent.com/blog/tag/glendora-ridge-road/">Glendora Ridge Rd</a>. We made the ride in the middle of November so we were comfortable riding with our kits &#x26; a vest. I wore my <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/gift-bundles/category/bundles">Rapha Lightweight Kit &#x26; Vest</a> &#x26; it suited me perfectly for the ride.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\'0\' allowtransparency=\'true\' style="min-height: 405px;" scrolling=\'no\' src=\'//www.strava.com/activities/432826817/embed/96dd9da58f55dc1ec44bc7fd57e72442ad7d36e7\'></iframe>',frontmatter:{featured_image:"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/gmr/gmr.jpg",meta:"Glendora Mountain Road is a road cycling paradise",title:"GMR a road cycling paradise",date:"November 17, 2015"}}},pathContext:{path:"/glendora-mountain-road/"}}}});
