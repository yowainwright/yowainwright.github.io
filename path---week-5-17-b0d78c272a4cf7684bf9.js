Or teams are also working on tool to make analytics more uniform across our web properties. </p>\n<h2>Fitness Work</h2>\n<p>I wasn’t able to surf as much because of continued rain. I made it to the rock gym a few times and my aparment gym a few more times. I got onto my bike and ran for a few <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335#interval?interval=201705&#x26;interval_type=week&#x26;chart_type=miles&#x26;year_offset=0">hours</a> as well. </p>\n<h2>Leo Cabrillo State Beach</h2>\n<p>Driving by Leo Cabrillo State Beach on Highway 1 has always been enjoyable. There’s a rock that juts out from the ocean and appears to be battling longboarder waves 24 hours a day. Also, if there’s been any rain, a stream flows out into the ocean. These are nice features of a beach. I had never really explored the beach beyond these observations though. I did that this week. Just north of the rocks and stream that is observable from highway are a few rock caves. The whole scene—the waves, the stream and the rock cave are memorable. I’m very glad I went.</p>\n<html><head></head><body><figure>\n  \n</figure></body></html>',frontmatter:{featured_image:"https://yowainwright.imgix.net/wk-5/leo-carillo-rock.jpg",meta:"Week 5, 2017—I was able to work on analytics for a current project and see Ocean Caves at Leo Carillo State Beach.",title:"Week 5, 2017—Analytics Tech and Viewing Ocean Caves",date:"February 15, 2017"}}},pathContext:{path:"/week-5-17/"}}}});
